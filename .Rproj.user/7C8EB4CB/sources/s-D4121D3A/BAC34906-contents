Tina Lasisi is a biological anthropologist and PhD Candidate at Penn State University. Her research helps us better understand human diversity and answer the question: ‘Why did modern variation in human scalp hair evolve?’

How does a closer look at variation in scalp hair texture uncover the complexity of human diversity? Using computational image analysis, we can look at hair variation without invoking racial terminology (e.g. Caucasian or "Afro" hair) or relying on subjective descriptions of hair. Join us as Lasisi explores the fascinating biology of human scalp hair variation. 

Moderator: Briana Pobiner, paleoanthropologist and educator at Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History.
 
This program is offered as part of the ongoing HOT (Human Origins Today) Topic series. 
 

This program will be presented as a Zoom video webinar. A link will be emailed to all registrants.
