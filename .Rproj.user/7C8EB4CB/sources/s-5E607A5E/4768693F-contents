abstract: Like many highly variable human traits, more than a dozen genes are known
  to contribute to the full range of skin color. However, the historical bias in favor
  of genetic studies in European and European-derived populations has blinded us to
  the magnitude of pigmentation's complexity. As deliberate efforts are being made
  to better characterize diverse global populations and new sequencing technologies,
  better measurement tools, functional assessments, predictive modeling, and ancient
  DNA analyses become more widely accessible, we are beginning to appreciate how limited
  our understanding of the genetic bases of human skin color have been. Novel variants
  in genes not previously linked to pigmentation have been identified and evidence
  is mounting that there are hundreds more variants yet to be found. Even for genes
  that have been exhaustively characterized in European populations like MC1R, OCA2,
  and SLC24A5, research in previously understudied groups is leading to a new appreciation
  of the degree to which genetic diversity, epistatic interactions, pleiotropy, admixture,
  global and local adaptation, and cultural practices operate in population-specific
  ways to shape the genetic architecture of skin color. Furthermore, we are coming
  to terms with how factors like tanning response and barrier function may also have
  influenced selection on skin throughout human history. By examining how our knowledge
  of pigmentation genetics has shifted in the last decade, we can better appreciate
  how far we have come in understanding human diversity and the still long road ahead
  for understanding many complex human traits.
