abstract: Hair is predominantly a proteinaceous fiber that originates from hair follicles
  located within the subcutis and/or dermis of the skin. It is one of the defining
  features of mammals, serving important functions, such as thermoregulation and endothermy.
  Among mammals, humans are exceptional in lacking a full covering of body hair. Instead
  the growth of terminal hairs is limited to specific body regions, such as the scalp,
  axillae, and groin. Our aim in this chapter is to provide an overview of the anthropology
  of human scalp hair. We will explore approaches to the study of variation in human
  scalp hair phenotypes, as well as the genetic and evolutionary basis of this diversity.
  The biology of human scalp hair, with emphasis on quantitative and qualitative differences
  among populations, as well as impact on hair grooming practices will also be discussed.
