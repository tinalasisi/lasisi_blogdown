However, the historical bias in favor of genetic studies in European and European-derived populations has blinded us to the magnitude of pigmentation's complexity. As deliberate efforts are being made to better characterize diverse global populations and new sequencing technologies, better measurement tools, functional assessments, predictive modeling, and ancient DNA analyses become more widely accessible, we are beginning to appreciate how limited our understanding of the genetic bases of human skin color have been. Novel variants in genes not previously linked to pigmentation have been identified and evidence is mounting that there are hundreds more variants yet to be found. Even for genes that have been exhaustively characterized in European populations like MC1R, OCA2, and SLC24A5, research in previously understudied groups is leading to a new appreciation of the degree to which genetic diversity, epistatic interactions, pleiotropy, admixture, global and local adaptation, and cultural practices operate in population-specific ways to shape the genetic architecture of skin color. Furthermore, we are coming to terms with how factors like tanning response and barrier function may also have influenced selection on skin throughout human history.

Going to all these lectures and learning about archaeology, social anthropology, and biological anthropology was really exciting.\nBut, the thing I loved most, was all the time we got to have with the professors in small group settings. To this day, I truly believe that this aspect of Cambridge education is why I feel so comfortable in academia, but that’s a story for another time.\nOne of the professors I spent the most time with, was the Archaeology professor at my college, Sir Paul Mellars.\nThis is a picture of him getting knighted by Prince Charles. I don\u0026#8217;t know why I find it so funny, but I can\u0026#8217;t help but laugh that I knew someone who went through such a fancy ritual.  I remember being terrified to meet him when I came to interview at Cambridge, but once I was actually in and after I’d had a few supervisions with him, that went away.\nI know y\u0026#8217;all be like \u0026#8220;pics or it didn\u0026#8217;t happen\u0026#8221;, so hereby, pics of me, Paul Mellars and the other lovely anthropology students at Corpus Christi College.  Professor Mellars is probably one of the most entertaining people I’ve ever met. Mostly because, in my eyes, he’s this fancy unicorn who is everything you’d imagine a Cambridge don to be.\nProfessor Mellars has this low booming voice, and he would often be smoking his pipe or a cigar in his office. Part of me kind of imagines that this is what Santa looks like in his time off, which is something I obviously never mentioned to his face (and since I don’t expect he’s online much, I don’t think he’ll ever find out).\nBut to get to the point, in our supervisions, he would always tell stories. It was one of my favorite things about him because, unlike other supervisors, he wouldn’t necessarily grill us with questions and I could rely on him doing most of the talking!\nOne of the things I distinctly remember talking with him about was Neandertals and why they had gone “extinct”.\nProfessor Mellars wasn’t just any random archaeologist, after all. What he was known and knighted for was, in part, his work on Neanderthals. He was an expert on stone tools of the Middle-Upper Paleolithic (~300,000-10,000 years ago).\nBy studying various stone tool industries across Europe, archaeologists are able to say something about who might have been making them and when certain people came into contact with others or were perhaps replaced.\nWhat we can learn from stone tools is awesome, but god I hated all my stone tool lectures and reading because looking at variously carved rocks for hours is something I simply don\u0026#8217;t have the attention span for. So based on the fossil evidence, the archaeological/stone tool evidence, and the genetic evidence (at the time), it appeared that Neanderthals had simply vanished at some point. Or in any case, at some point, the skeletal morphology and stone tools we associate with Neanderthals was gone, and that time seemed to coincide with what was interpreted as the arrival of “anatomically modern humans”.\nThere was a lot of debate, but very few people who studied human evolution believed that Neanderthals had contributed to the modern human gene pool.\nBack in 2012, during my second year, I remember writing essays about why Neanderthals might have disappeared, and evaluating the evidence about them having gone extinct vs having interbred with us. I remember asking Professor Mellars what he thought, and he said it was unlikely Neanderthals interbred with us.\nMost of what I read about the disappearance of Neanderthals was that “modern humans” must have outcompeted Neanderthals with our superior cognitive skills or replaced them after they disappeared due to their inability to adapt to the changing climate.\nI couldn’t put my finger on it at the time, but I felt weird about the language that was being used around Neanderthals.\nIt also felt really uncomfortable that all explanations about this apparent disappearance of Neanderthals seemed to be centered on a post-hoc explanation of why “we” were simply better than them. Despite being wrapped in the language of natural selection, it seemed oddly similar to 19th-century arguments naturalizing colonialism and the “inevitable demise” of certain peoples. And I am certainly not the first person to draw the link between natural selection, eugenics, and colonialism.\nBut over the last few years, a lot of things have changed.\n Theories on how humans evolved: one origin or multiple? Before genetic evidence really came onto the scene, most of what we had to base our understanding of human evolution on was fossil evidence.\nLooking at this fossil evidence, during the late 20th century, two camps had formed: multiregionalists and those who thought modern humans were the product of a single-out-of-Africa expansion (clearly, the latter had a much less catchy group name, but I digress…)\nMultiregionalists saw continuity between the skeletal anatomy of archaic hominins (i.e. Neanderthals in Europe and Homo erectus in Asia) and the respective modern populations in each continent. For example, some researchers emphasized the similarity between the “shovel-shaped” teeth found in Homo erectus, and the presence of similar dental morphology in modern East Asian populations.\nOn the other hand, proponents of the single ‘Out of Africa’ hypothesis saw similarities between the skeletal morphology of late African Homo specimens and all modern humans. Some even went as far as to claim that all modern humans were the result of a ‘cognitive behavioral revolution’ around 70,000 years ago.\nIn the late 1980’s, when researchers were finally able to sequence mtDNA (DNA that is inherited maternally), it appeared to support the idea that all humans today traced their ancestry back, exclusively, to a single group based in Africa around 200,000 years ago.\nAfter this, most people abandoned the multiregional hypothesis of human origins, but also any idea that Neanderthals (or other hominins) might have contributed to the modern gene pool at all.\n The new kid on the block: Ancient DNA Reading about the history of science is fascinating because it shows the extent to which our knowledge is shaped by the technology we have, but also the questions we choose to ask and the tools we use to answer those questions.\nIf you’re at all interested in understanding how weird and winding this path to our current understanding of Neanderthal/Denisovan/ancient human genetics was, I’d recommend you read Svante Pääbo’s autobiography ‘Neanderthal Man‘ where he discusses how he developed the methods that allowed researchers to extract and sequence ancient DNA.\nBut to get back to our story, when we began analyzing ancient DNA, it was a pain and it was difficult. Getting even a small sequence was a huge victory. So when they got a bit of Neanderthal mtDNA sequenced in the late 1990’s, it was something worth celebrating.\nWhen complete Neanderthal mtDNA sequences followed in 2008 and 2009, while exciting, the evidence still was in line with a single out of Africa expansion.\nBut then, everything changed in 2010.\nWhat many researchers in human evolution thought was true fundamentally changed when Svante Pääbo’s group published the draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome and concluded that there was evidence of Neanderthal introgression (genetic contribution) to modern day populations outside of Africa.\nIn the same year, their group also published the mitochondrial (mtDNA) sequence of an unknown hominin, that appeared to group neither with modern humans nor with Neanderthals – we now refer to them as Denisovans.\nOnce we were able to sequence the nuclear genomes of both Neanderthals and Denisovans, we were able to get the full picture, rather than just the matrilineal side of things.\nWhile there was an “ancient DNA rush” during this time, not everyone was convinced.\nIn fact, people were proposing alternative hypotheses based on ancient population structure that could explain the genetic similarity we see between non-Africans and Neanderthals. In other words, what we see could be explained by the fact that non-Africans came from an ancestral population that was genetically more similar to Neanderthals, but they did not interbreed with them.\nNowadays, we have commercially available genetic reports like 23andMe that will tell you just how Neanderthal you are. It’s unbelievable to think that only 5-6 years ago, many researchers would have thought that was plain wrong.\nUnfortunately, I\u0026#8217;m pretty low in Neanderthal since I\u0026#8217;m 50% African, but I\u0026#8217;m excited to get my mom\u0026#8217;s results!  Who is human and who is not? One of the funny things I recall from undergrad is being told that I shouldn’t refer to Neanderthals as “humans” – that was reserved for “modern humans”.\nWhen you think about it, that’s what this discussion is all about. From the beginning of anthropology, and even taxonomy, one of the key questions has been “who is human and who is not?” Is that line drawn between white Europeans and everyone else? Is that line drawn between Eurasians and Africans? Or is it drawn at some point in time, between those whose descendants are present today and those who have left no trace of their existence in populations today? And who gets to decide?\nThis is one of the most difficult questions in human evolution: what does it mean to be human?\nThis question is the reason why we have such awkward terminology as “modern humans” and “anatomically modern humans” and “behaviorally/cognitively modern humans” – they are all just clumsy attempts to essentialize the differences between groups of closely related people. But you can’t essentialize “humanness” because evolution doesn’t lend itself to clear divisions.\nSome people still believe in the biological species concept. Meaning that we can define a species as a group of individuals that can bear fertile offspring.

Nope, PhD students get to go through the fun of taking an exam that determines whether they actually get to stay in grad school. Yay! Since a few of my very close friends in grad school are preparing to go through this cruel, yet inescapable, rite of passage, I\u0026#8217;ve decided to write up all the tips I can think of to help them out on their journey. In my exceedingly finite wisdom, I have conjured up a list of 5-ish steps to passing comprehensive exams in grad school. Since I just took these a year ago, the (painful) experience is still very much a recent memory, so this seems as good a time as any to pass on the knowledge I have gained to the next batch of students. Now, you may be wondering why I\u0026#8217;m writing about this so dramatically. If you are, you\u0026#8217;re probably not taking these exams any time soon. Because if you were\u0026#8230; YOU\u0026#8217;D BE FREAKING OUT TOO! One of the things I hate most is when I’m panicking and someone tells me to ‘calm down’\nOr, even worst, when they tell me \u0026#8220;there\u0026#8217;s nothing to worry about\u0026#8221;\u0026#8230; With all due respect, I am perfectly able to decide what is and what is not worth worrying about. As is every other grad student. And if you\u0026#8217;re about to do some exam that\u0026#8217;s going to decide whether you do or don\u0026#8217;t get to stay in grad school, then you, my friend, have a perfectly valid reason to freak out. So, to all my fellow grad students about to go through this ordeal: YOU\u0026#8217;RE FREAKING OUT! I\u0026#8217;M FREAKING OUT! BUT WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER!!!! You\u0026#8217;ll have moments when you feel totally fine and in control of the situation. You\u0026#8217;ll have moments when you don\u0026#8217;t feel okay at all. These moments will come and go, but they are not an accurate reflection of how prepared you are, or your ability to be a good student. Accept whatever way you feel right now, whether it is good or bad. It will pass. The most important thing is that you keep going and keep doing whatever is best for you.  With that pep talk out of the way, I will share with you what I think are the 5 essential steps to successfully completing your comprehensive exams.  Note that I say 5 steps, not 5 tips/pointers/points. The order is important and intentional here. I realize that not everything will be relevant to all grad students everywhere, but hopefully, there will be something useful in here for anyone who is in grad school or is considering this in the future. 1. Figure out the basics: when, where, what are your exams?  The most important thing you need to do is figure out exactly what it is you\u0026#8217;re actually doing. Don\u0026#8217;t assume anything here. Do you have a graduate handbook? Check it. When is your exam?  Does it tell you a specific date for your exams?   Does it tell you what semester you are expected to have completed it?   Where is your exam?  Where will it be held?   How big is the room?   How many people are taking it at once?   Do you have to organize the time/date/venue yourself? Is there a Head of Graduate studies (or equivalent) that is in charge of this? And last, but not least: What is your exam?  Is it a written exam, or is it oral?   Is it typed or handwritten?   Do you know the questions in advance?   Is it a take-home?   What is the format/how many questions must you answer?   How is it graded?   These are basic questions that are very important and should be sorted out as early as possible. Your graduate handbook may be a little vague, so speak to staff and previous cohorts to figure out how it\u0026#8217;s been done before. 2. Look at past exams (questions/answers) \u0026 talk to previous cohorts  Past exams are the best resource for preparing yourself. Normally, these will be available through the department, so get access to them whenever you can. Looking at past exam questions (over a period of 5-10 years) will give you an idea of the kinds of questions that keep coming up over and over again. It will also give you an idea of how questions are asked. What concepts are linked/contrasted? What level of detailed knowledge do you need to answer a question? Ideally, you would also have access to past answers. The department may not make past answers available to students, but it is possible that previous cohorts still have their exam answers. If you\u0026#8217;re super lucky like me, you\u0026#8217;ll be in a department where students decided to start collecting past exam answers to pass them on to future generations! (Consider starting this tradition if it doesn\u0026#8217;t exist at your university.) Past exam answers (especially when you know the grade received) are super useful because they give you a great idea of what you need to aim for to pass your exam. If you have past exams available to you, READ THEM! And the more of them you read, the better. Reading a lot of past exams will show you what good answers have in common, as well as the ways in which you can be different and still successful. Once you read a number of these, you\u0026#8217;ll also get a feel for what does and does not work. This allows you to get a glimpse of the perspective the faculty will have (who are grading this). And talk to previous cohorts! They have a wealth of knowledge about how your specific graduate program works and their advice will likely be a little more relevant than the advice of faculty who have taken their comprehensives 10+ years ago. So, I\u0026#8217;d like to take this moment to thank all the students in the years above me who have helped me: 3. Assess how much time you have to prepare and plan accordingly  Before you dive into studying, you need to take stock of how much time you have to prepare. Since you already know when you\u0026#8217;re taking the exams thanks to Step 1, this shouldn\u0026#8217;t be too hard. This is important because if you are starting to study 1 year before your exams, you\u0026#8217;ll have a different you\u0026#8217;ll have a different approach to preparing than if you\u0026#8217;re starting 2 months in advance. Based off of my experience, people are usually busy with coursework and other things before they take their comprehensives, so you likely won\u0026#8217;t start (seriously) studying for these until the semester before, or the start of the semester in which you\u0026#8217;re taking the exams. Considering this kind of timeline, I like to think in weeks. In other words, how many weeks until you have to take your exams? Thinking in weeks will allow you to divide up your remaining time into the as many chunks as you have topics. For example, this is what my preparation schedule looked like: Make sure that the time spent on each topic is proportional to its representation in your exams (based on past years). Some people like to start with the most difficult thing, others like to start with the easiest. Personally, I go somewhere in between. My reasoning is that, if you start with the most difficult thing, you\u0026#8217;ll get discouraged because you\u0026#8217;re not making progress quickly. Conversely, if you leave the most difficult things last, you\u0026#8217;ll be too stressed to work on something you already find difficult. So, I like to do things in the order:  Neither hard nor easy.   Really hard.   Easy.   That way, you can use the momentum of the first few tasks to motivate you for the difficult stuff and by the end, you have something pretty simple to work on before your big day. Have I overthought this? Yes, I absolutely have. And a final note on planning: stay on track, but be flexible. I\u0026#8217;m not just doing this to be annoying, I swear. What I mean is that you shouldn\u0026#8217;t consistently work on a topic for longer than you planned to; you can\u0026#8217;t sacrifice one topic for the sake of another. It really is better to know a little about everything that will be on your exams, than to be an expert on 1 topic and know nothing about the rest. Once you\u0026#8217;ve understood the basics of a topic and you\u0026#8217;ve run out of time, move on, and come back to it if you have time later. That said, if you have to switch stuff around, that\u0026#8217;s no problem. In terms of the pitfalls of overscheduling for your candidacies, point 2 of my first blog post full of wisdom may be useful. 4. Understand diminishing returns: doing the most will hurt you  Within each topic that you study, you have to prioritize the information that requires the least effort to gather and provides you with the highest payoff. Remember, you are not writing a thesis in each of these topics, you just need to write enough to show that you know what you are talking about. Based on the past exams, you should have a good idea of the breadth and depth that is expected of you. Usually, you need to know the most important concepts, authors, and examples for each of the topics. You then need to be able to discuss how these are related to each other and how they are relevant to whatever question was asked.  You do NOT need to be able to regurgitate the title and date of every single article that was ever written by some important person.   You do NOT need to know the details of every method that was discussed in the relevant papers.   One of the biggest mistakes students make is getting caught up in the details. This is either by going into too much breadth or into too much depth. This is a prime example of a case in which doing the most will hurt you! You have a finite amount of time to study for this and any time spent studying one topic is time taken away from studying another topic. It\u0026#8217;s a comprehensive exam, which suggests you should learn ALL THE THINGS. But you CANNOT learn ALL the things. So, don\u0026#8217;t try. Do what you can, and that will be enough! 5. Learn how to write exam essays  (Note: if you don’t need to write essays, you may want to skip to the last section)\nI did my undergraduate degree at the University of Cambridge, which is a weird place for many reasons. It\u0026#8217;s really old. People there wear gowns at an unnecessarily high frequency. It has many weird traditions (like a graduation ceremony completely in Latin\u0026#8230;). But the weirdest, in my opinion, was the fact that you only had exams once a year. These exams consisted of a few days of spending 3 hours in some giant old hall writing essays about everything you had learnt that year, citations included, no notes allowed. It also didn\u0026#8217;t help that the professors who proctored those exams wore long gowns that made them look just like dementors\u0026#8230;  Rare footage of Cambridge professors preparing to proctor an exam   But back to the essay exams. Your entire grade for the year (and your degree, during the final year) depended on whether you did well on those few days where you had to sit down for 3 hours and write 3 essays answering 3 questions that could be on any topic you had learnt for a class that year. I thought it was the most ridiculous thing ever. When are you ever going to be locked up in a room for 3 hours and have to write a coherent commentary (with citations) with no notes????  And then I came to grad school\u0026#8230;\u0026#8230;\u0026#8230;\u0026#8230;\u0026#8230;\u0026#8230;\u0026#8230;\u0026#8230;\u0026#8230;\u0026#8230;  So, luckily, this was the one thing I felt kind of prepared for when I had to take my comprehensive exams last year. The most important thing I learnt during my time at Cambridge is that preparing for such exams requires learning and practicing how to write exam essays. You may have written essays before, but an exam essay is a whole other beast. With that in mind, I have some tips specifically for writing exam essays. Read the question, re-read the question, then read it again.  This is pretty straightforward, but frequently overlooked. I\u0026#8217;ve known people who\u0026#8217;ve gotten poor marks for writing a great essay that answered a question they wished they\u0026#8217;d gotten, rather than the question they were supposed to answer. Always make sure you are answering the question that was asked. Write an outline  Never just start writing, you need an outline. Concept maps may be a good start. This post has some good tips on how to use these \u0026#8216;mind maps\u0026#8217; for essay writing. When you write your outline:  Read the question carefully.   Extract the main points from the question.   Brainstorm everything that is relevant to those points and vomit it out on a piece of paper.   Collect your word vomit and organize it into groups of related ideas.   Organize those ideas into paragraphs.   Frame those paragraphs by adding an introduction and a conclusion that answers the question.   So your final outline will look something like this:  Introduction   A direct answer to the question.   An explanation of how you will answer the question in this essay.     Your first main point   Your second main point   Your third main point   (Potentially a 4th main point, but you likely won\u0026#8217;t have time for this)   Conclusion   Recap how you have answered the question with your points.     In brief, follow the classic essay-writing advice: Say what you are going to say, say it, then say what you have said. When you are writing this outline, realize that you will not be able to write everything ever written about the topic. You probably won\u0026#8217;t even be able to write everything you know about the topic. These essays are not a test of who can write the most, so don\u0026#8217;t try to do that. Prioritize the most important information. How do you know what\u0026#8217;s important? Think about what your professors have been emphasizing when talking about this \u0026#8211; writing about this will show you\u0026#8217;ve paid attention. Also, consider your answer to the question. What pieces of evidence are most relevant to the answer you are giving? You have to strike a balance between showing you have a good amount of knowledge and show that you can answer a question concisely. It\u0026#8217;s not easy, but there are some tricks. One thing I like to do is make my point and then add a little \u0026#8220;of course, there are other considerations, but these are beyond the scope of this essay.\u0026#8221; This shows that you know these other things exist, but you are consciously choosing not to discuss them. Remember that what you want to avoid here is a listing effect, i.e. \u0026#8220;A said X, B said Y, C said Z etc.\u0026#8221; Synthesize, don\u0026#8217;t list. This means you have to show you have thought about the question and can do more than regurgitate \u0026#8220;facts\u0026#8221; about it. The best way to do this is to \u0026#8216;pick a side\u0026#8217;. Usually, the prompts to an essay question will give you the opportunity to argue one thing or another. You do not have to necessarily believe 100% in the side you are picking, but it will make writing the essay a whole lot easier if you don\u0026#8217;t try to argue both sides, because that\u0026#8217;s like trying to sing both parts to \u0026#8220;The Boy Is Mine\u0026#8221; \u0026#8211; it comes across as muddled and rushed, and you do not sound good at all.  Who can resist singing both parts to this song? It\u0026#8217;s a universal struggle   TIMING IS EVERYTHING  If you have a timed exam, you need to make sure you know how to write under time pressure. If you know when you\u0026#8217;re exam is going to be, you should also know how long your exam will take. So, for example, my undergraduate exams were 3 hours long and I had to answer three questions, so I had about 1 hour per essay. For my comprehensives in grad school, the exams were 6 hours each for 3 questions, so that was 2 hours per essay. That does not mean I had 2 hours to write because I had to factor in time for writing the outline beforehand and time to re-read what I wrote afterwards. For a two hour essay, this looks like:  10-15 mins brainstorming an outline   90 mins actually writing   10-15 mins re-reading and correcting   Now, this may be controversial, but I would advise that you write ALL of your outlines at the beginning and do all of your re-reading at the end. For me, that meant spending 30 mins at the beginning of my 6-hour exam \u0026#8220;just\u0026#8221; brainstorming and outlining what I was going to write later on. It may seem like a lot of time to sacrifice, and you may want to start writing immediately, but trust me, it\u0026#8217;s worth it! When you enter the last 1-2 hours of your exam and you\u0026#8217;re stressed out staring at a blank page in front of you, you may not write the most coherent essay. And writing something coherent is much more important than writing a lot! If you spend this time making a detailed outline, you can just switch your brain off afterwards and write nonstop. (Switching your brain off a little too much, is also why it may be worthwhile to spend some time re-reading at the end, though\u0026#8230;) Practice writing under time pressure These things are like a marathon. You can\u0026#8217;t expect to do it without any practice. Getting an idea of what you are capable of writing under similar circumstances will make you feel more prepared for the day of the exam. In the last few weeks before your exam, schedule in a couple of sessions where you practice writing under time pressure. If your exam is 6 hours long, that may be a bit much, but doing a 2-hour stint to write 1 essay would be a good idea at least once or twice. Then practice writing outlines in under 10 minutes, and you\u0026#8217;ll be golden. PEEL: recipe for easy paragraphs  As you\u0026#8217;re writing each paragraph, you don\u0026#8217;t want to be thinking about how to have the best possible flow. To avoid this, I use a little \u0026#8216;recipe\u0026#8217; for writing paragraphs that will clearly communicate to those grading the exam what I am trying to argue:  Point: What is the point you want to make in this paragraph.   A brief sentence (or two) stating the main argument/point of this paragraph.     Explanation: Why are you talking about this, what is the relevance?   Elaborate what you mean by your previous statement.     Example: What is an example of this?   Throw in a couple examples of the point your making. This is where you show off that you know the main authors and dates of important publications.     Link: How does this relate to the question you are answering.   Always make sure you synthesize and answer the question, so explain how this point is related to your main argument (and perhaps other paragraphs).     Standard phrases (introductions, transitions, conclusions)  You have no time to waste on \u0026#8216;phrasing\u0026#8217;, so prepare some standard introductions, transitions, and conclusions beforehand.  Introductions:   \u0026#8216;In this essay, I will explain how X and Y appear to be related but are actually completely separate and independent phenomena\u0026#8217;     Transitions:   \u0026#8220;Alternatively, however, nevertheless, albeit\u0026#8221;     Conclusions   \u0026#8220;To sum up, all in all, in conclusion\u0026#8221;     Just google around for \u0026#8220;transition words/phrases\u0026#8221; and you\u0026#8217;ll come across lists like this one. Going the extra mile: originality  I remember reading the grading rubrics when I was in undergrad and thinking that they were hella vague. Especially looking at what distinguished a \u0026#8216;passing\u0026#8217; grade from an \u0026#8216;excellent\u0026#8217; grade was confusing to me because they would always talk about \u0026#8216;originality\u0026#8217;. What is originality in an exam essay, even??? After a few years of jumping the hoop of exam essays, I think I sort of understand what they\u0026#8217;re looking for. What you need is just a little flair. JUST A LITTLE. Remember that this is the cherry on top, and it cannot come at the expense of the other requirements, such as \u0026#8216;having a good grasp of the topic\u0026#8217;, \u0026#8216;adequate breadth and depth\u0026#8217; etc. In my opinion, the best (and safest) way to show a bit of originality is throwing in a few \u0026#8216;unexpected\u0026#8217; citations. This shows you\u0026#8217;ve gone beyond the required reading and are able to see how \u0026#8216;new\u0026#8217; material relates to what you\u0026#8217;ve already been taught. These may be very new articles or very old ones. These could also be references drawn from another subject/discipline. You can also impress those grading your exam by going against the grain and arguing something that is unorthodox for this particular subject (but make sure you\u0026#8217;re able to support your points with good evidence). My standard approach to adding in the flare is throwing in a little somethin\u0026#8217; somethin\u0026#8217; in the 3rd or 4th paragraph: \u0026#8220;While it is widely accepted that X is related to Y by Z, new evidence from the field of Industrial Unicorn Fabrication Theory suggests that we should consider\u0026#8230;.\u0026#8221; This is a great opportunity to use your specific knowledge about something that may be relatively niche and give the faculty a chance to read something interesting that may set you apart from the dozens of other essays they\u0026#8217;ve read answering the exact same question. But, honestly, as far as originality goes, make sure you don\u0026#8217;t go overboard because it can be a huge timesuck that makes your essay super confusing if you go off on a weird tangent. (In undergrad, I had the brilliant idea of trying to do some kind of innovative analysis involving obscure French philosophers during a timed essay exam. Don\u0026#8217;t do that. Trust me, it\u0026#8217;s a mistake.) Originality is the glitter of the exam essay world. Use it responsibly. A note on mental health and wellbeing  While preparing for the essay writing is important, your mental (and physical) health during this stressful time should not be overlooked. When I was preparing for my comprehensives last year, I got into a great routine. I was doing pretty well. I was eating regularly, even exercising a bit. I was making good progress on my revision for the exams and I even managed to do a few timed essay sessions. On top of all of that, I had done this kind of exam before, so I had every reason to be calm and relaxed. But the night before my first exam, I could not fall asleep. And knowing how important it is to get a good night\u0026#8217;s sleep before big events, this frustrated me even more. My heart rate was so high and it felt like my heart was beating out of my chest. No amount of melatonin or other \u0026#8216;calming\u0026#8217; supplements would help. I kept trying to sleep but it wasn\u0026#8217;t until 5 or 6 in the morning that I managed to finally drift off and my exam was at 9am. I was so nauseous in the morning, I couldn\u0026#8217;t stand to eat anything. When I got to my office, I tried to have more coffee because I thought it could compensate for my lack of sleep. My hands were shaking so hard that I dropped my mug and broke it before I could even fill it with coffee. I somehow managed to get through the exam (even though one of my essays was horrible, in my opinion). Two days later, I had to take the second part of the written exam and I still couldn\u0026#8217;t relax or sleep. After the second part of the written exam, my heart was still beating like crazy and it seemed like there was nothing I could do to calm myself down. I was so angry at myself. Why was my body doing this? Was I having some kind of reaction to something? What was wrong? There was nothing I could do to beat my body into submission. I even tried running myself into exhaustion in the hopes that I could sleep better, but even that didn\u0026#8217;t help. After the second exam, I ended up going to the doctor who explained to me that I was having panic attacks. I refused to believe it. I had no rational reason to have a panic attack. I was convinced that it had to be something else that was stopping me from sleeping and making my heart go crazy. But, unfortunately for me, she explained that panic attacks were not something you could rationalize away. Luckily, with her help, I managed to get things under control somewhat by the time I had the oral part of my examination the week after. And luckily, I did pretty okay on my exams, despite all of this. But, in hindsight, I did not do a great job of taking care of myself. I had a good idea of what I had to do, but I thought if I just pushed harder and harder, I could force myself to do better. I was taking enough melatonin to put a horse to sleep (and more is not better, in this case), and in the mornings I was taking enough caffeine to bring the dead back to life. And this is not taking into account the 20 other supplements I ordered from Amazon in the hopes of improving my memory and sleep. So why am I (over)sharing this with you? I just want to emphasize that exam preparation involves self care as well. This may mean different things for different people, but it\u0026#8217;s important for everyone. Spend time with the people you love. Get some fresh air. Speak with a therapist (honestly, not a bad investment for grad school). Be consistent with your medications, if you are taking any. Watch something that makes you laugh. Cuddle with something fluffy. Reach out and ask for help when you need it. To everyone preparing for these exams, I wish you the best of luck. You are awesome and you\u0026#8217;re a superhero. This won\u0026#8217;t be the most fun part of this PhD, but remember that you started this because you love what you do and you have an insatiable sense of curiosity and wonder. There will be great times ahead once you finish these exams, I promise.

Nope, PhD students get to go through the fun of taking an exam that determines whether they actually get to stay in grad school. Yay! Since a few of my very close friends in grad school are preparing to go through this cruel, yet inescapable, rite of passage, I\u0026#8217;ve decided to write up all the tips I can think of to help them out on their journey. In my exceedingly finite wisdom, I have conjured up a list of 5-ish steps to passing comprehensive exams in grad school. Since I just took these a year ago, the (painful) experience is still very much a recent memory, so this seems as good a time as any to pass on the knowledge I have gained to the next batch of students. Now, you may be wondering why I\u0026#8217;m writing about this so dramatically. If you are, you\u0026#8217;re probably not taking these exams any time soon. Because if you were\u0026#8230; YOU\u0026#8217;D BE FREAKING OUT TOO! One of the things I hate most is when I’m panicking and someone tells me to ‘calm down’\nOr, even worst, when they tell me \u0026#8220;there\u0026#8217;s nothing to worry about\u0026#8221;\u0026#8230; With all due respect, I am perfectly able to decide what is and what is not worth worrying about. As is every other grad student. And if you\u0026#8217;re about to do some exam that\u0026#8217;s going to decide whether you do or don\u0026#8217;t get to stay in grad school, then you, my friend, have a perfectly valid reason to freak out. So, to all my fellow grad students about to go through this ordeal: YOU\u0026#8217;RE FREAKING OUT! I\u0026#8217;M FREAKING OUT! BUT WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER!!!! You\u0026#8217;ll have moments when you feel totally fine and in control of the situation. You\u0026#8217;ll have moments when you don\u0026#8217;t feel okay at all. These moments will come and go, but they are not an accurate reflection of how prepared you are, or your ability to be a good student. Accept whatever way you feel right now, whether it is good or bad. It will pass. The most important thing is that you keep going and keep doing whatever is best for you.  With that pep talk out of the way, I will share with you what I think are the 5 essential steps to successfully completing your comprehensive exams.

You mean, Jessie? Her hair is light brown\u0026#8221;  \u0026#8220;No, it\u0026#8217;s clearly dark blonde\u0026#8221;  \u0026#8220;You need to get your eyes checked, that\u0026#8217;s light brown\u0026#8221;  /end scene Same goes for dark brown to black. And I’m pretty sure I’ve heard people argue that they’re not ‘redheads’ but actually they’re ‘strawberry blonde’.\nBut how can hair color be so debatable?\nWell, it’s because hair color categories are an illusion.\nHair color categories are arbitrary groups that we distinguish and name.\nAnd clearly, they can be highly subjective…\nThere is no absolute way to categorize someone’s hair color.\nWho is blond/brunette or strawberry blond/red-haired depends on how you decide to define those categories.\nTo show you why hair color categories are a lie and how we get the amazing palette of hair colors we see today, I’ve decided to share with you guys how hair gets its color.\nOverview of today\u0026#8217;s post:  Hair gets its color from a pigment called melanin, which is found in a red/yellow form (pheomelanin) and a brown/black form (eumelanin). The ratio and absolute amount of these pigments determine the color of hair.   Melanin is produced in melanosomes (organelles) of the melanocytes (melanin-producing cells) in hair follicles during the anagen (growth) phase. (Feel free to check out the beginner\u0026#8217;s guide to hair growth \u0026 anatomy if you need a refresher.)   Melanosomes are then transferred from the melanocytes to keratinocytes (keratin-producing cells) and produce pigmented hair shafts.   If this overview went too fast for you, no worries, we’re going to break it down below:\nYou may have heard of the word melanin before. On this blog, you can expect to hear it all the time because I’m all about the pigment (and so is my research)! In this first post on melanin, I will introduce you to a number of melanin-related vocabulary as I give you a basic description of melanin production. You may be wondering, for someone studying human hair diversity, why would I be interested in the process of hair pigmentation? The answer is: all the steps in the process of hair pigmentation are points at which we can have variation. At each step, something can go wrong/right/differently. This means that the final result (i.e. hair color) can change because of any of this reasons. So, for someone who is interested in how and why humans vary in hair color, understanding all the things that could possibly cause the differences we observe is pretty important! Hopefully, this will motivate you to bear with me through the explanations of the process so we can understand the how all of this diversity came to be! (I am a firm believer in the positive power of exclamation marks so I have no doubt you have been bathed in motivation by the last few sentences \u0026#8211; you are totally welcome!) Melanin-producing cells called melanocytes are responsible for the pigmentation of keratin-producing cells called keratinocytes. Melanocytes and keratinocytes are both found in hair, as well as in skin. There is a special set of melanocytes called the hair follicle pigmentary unit that is responsible for pigmenting the hair shaft. These melanocytes are found in the hair bulb, above and around the dermal papilla.1  Melanin production + vocabulary Melanogenesis is the production of melanin. In pigmented human hair, we may find both pheomelanin (a red-yellow pigment) and eumelanin (a brown-black pigment). The entire process of melanogenesis takes place in melanocytes (cyte = cell). Inside the melanocyte, melanin is produced inside melanosomes (organelles related to lysosomes). Now, the biological pathway for melanin synthesis is complex (although I have to say, I don\u0026#8217;t think I\u0026#8217;ve ever come across a biological pathway that was not complex). This means that we can ease into that topic in a later blog post! For now, all you need to know is that the melanosomes mature in the melanocytes before being transferred into the keratinocytes of the forming hair shaft.2 Another micrograph of hairs, just for the hell of it. These are a bit more red in color than the first hairs you saw in this post.  Melanosome transfer As mentioned above, pigmented hair shafts get their color from the melanin-filled organelles (melanosomes) that are transferred to the keratin-cells of the hair shafts (keratinocytes). So, how did these melanosomes end up in keratinocytes? Over the years much knowledge has been generated by researchers who have looked into the black box process that is melanosome transfer. Over these many years, thoughts about how these organelles end up keratinocytes have evolved, and so has the technology we have available to us. For example, now we can see cells \u0026#8216;in action\u0026#8217; and, as you can imagine can give us a completely different picture of the dynamic process that is melanosome transfer. Taking this important bit of history into consideration, we can describe four types of hypotheses put forward about how exactly melanosomes end up in keratinocytes3,4:  Membrane fusion. Melanocytes are dendritic cells, which means they have tentacle-like protrusions sticking out of the body of the cell. This hypothesis suggests that melanosomes may be transferred by a fusion of the cell membranes of melanocytes (and their dendrites) to keratinocytes, after which the melanosomes pass through this \u0026#8216;channel\u0026#8217;.   Shedding-phagocytosis. Another hypothesis is that melanosomes are packaged in little membrane-bound vesicles that are \u0026#8216;shed\u0026#8217; by the melanocyte and are then phagocytized (\u0026#8220;eaten\u0026#8221;) by the keratinocyte.   Exocytosis-endocytosis. This hypothesis proposes that melanosomes are released without being packaged and bound into the intercellular space and then incorporated by the keratinocyte.   Cytophagocytosis. Lastly, it has been suggested that the keratinocyte may be actively phagocytizing melanosome-rich dendrites.   There is the most evidence for the shedding-phagocytosis mechanism.4  Regardless, once the melanosomes are transferred to keratinocytes, these cells are pigmented, and as the hair shaft grows from the hair follicle, a pigmented hair will appear.  Same process; different colors The same process of melanogenesis described above can produce very different hair colors.  In some cases, hair follicles right next to each other can produce very different hair colors. These hairs all come from the same spot on one person\u0026#8217;s scalp.  Regardless of the final color of the hair shaft, all pigmented hairs get their color from melanin. This melanin comes in two forms: pheomelanin (red-yellow) and eumelanin (brown-black). And the funny thing is that all pigmented hairs have BOTH types of melanin. The lightest strawberry blond hair will contain brown-black eumelanin and the darkest black hair will contain red-yellow pheomelanin.\nSo, as you can see, understanding hair color is not a simple matter of looking at a hair and describing its color.\nSo, if the process of pigmenting hairs is the same for all hair colors, and the building blocks are the same – why do we see differences?\nThe reason for this is that the absolute amount of melanin and the ratio of the two melanins can be different. But, ultimately, combining pheomelanin and eumelanin in various amounts and ratios is what produces all hair colors!\nSo, next time you get into a debate about the precise cut-off between dark blond and light brown, remember that those categories are absolutely arbitrary and this is a pointless debate.\nAlthough, as someone who feels very strongly about the pronunciation of GIF, I completely understand if hair color is something you want to fight about…\n[blog_subscription_form]\n  References: Schneider, M.

And it was AWESOME! Funny thing is I only found out I was going to this conference about two weeks before it started. How did that happen? Well, I\u0026#8217;m glad you asked\u0026#8230; So, at the moment, I\u0026#8217;m in the process of putting together my doctoral committee. Basically, I\u0026#8217;m asking a bunch of professors if they would kindly agree to evaluate my work and be the judges at my defense when I finish up this Ph.D. 100% real genuine footage of a doctoral committee judging a Ph.D. student on the verge of tears. In September, I met a professor who was potentially going to be on my committee (he has since agreed, yay!). This professor, Larry Kenney, is a professor in Kinesiology \u0026amp; Physiology. (This may not immediately seem like a logical choice of committee member for an anthropologist studying hair, but Dr. Kenney knows a lot about thermoregulation which is handy if you want to figure out whether human hair morphology affects our ability to stay cool in the sun.)\nTowards the end of October, Dr. Kenney introduced me to a collaborator of his who would be able to help me with designing the experiments for my research, Dr. George Havenith. Since Dr. George Havenith was based at Loughborough University in the UK, our first conversation was over Skype. Our virtual meeting went very well! We talked about some ideas for experiments and simulations, I even had the chance to flex my Dutch language skills as both Dr. Havenith and I are from the Netherlands. This is where things got interesting. Dr. Havenith and Dr. Kenney mentioned they were going to a conference in Japan in three weeks. Then they suggested that I should come along. I was, as the kids say, SHOOK. At first, I thought they were joking, but they insisted that this would be a great opportunity for me to present my ideas to a crowd of experts who could give me feedback and ideas on how to test my hypotheses. Needless to say, I did not need a lot of convincing. When someone asks you \u0026#8220;Do you want to go to Japan?\u0026#8221; you say \u0026#8220;How long do I have to pack my bags?\u0026#8221;  But realistically, this conference was in 3 weeks and I did not have the kind of spare cash lying around to go on a trip like this. I didn\u0026#8217;t think this was going to happen, but Dr. Kenney and Dr. Havenith encouraged me to ask my advisor about it. In the Netherlands, we have this great saying: \u0026#8216;Nee\u0026#8217; heb je al, \u0026#8216;ja\u0026#8217; kun je krijgen. Which translates to:\nYou already have \u0026#8216;no\u0026#8217;, but you could get a \u0026#8216;yes\u0026#8217;.  Basically, this is the Dutch version of \u0026#8220;it never hurts to ask\u0026#8221;. And boy was this true. I asked my advisor (Dr. Nina Jablonski) and she immediately said: \u0026#8220;Yes, this is a great idea, let\u0026#8217;s get it sorted out ASAP.\u0026#8221; She said \u0026#8216;yes\u0026#8217;??? Then, in about one week I had to throw together an abstract + a poster to send to the conference organizers. I thought I was real slick for getting myself into this conference, but when I was writing the 5th version of the abstract and the 245th draft of the poster I definitely was slightly less enthused about the whole thing. 10/10 would **_not_** recommend making a poster in a week because this is what you will feel like. But luckily it all worked out in the end and I had my poster and I was going to JAPAN!!!!\nTalia was just as happy as I was that this poster was finally done because she\u0026#8217;s supportive like that  And yes, you read that correctly this was the first poster presentation of my academic career! I\u0026#8217;ve noticed that in the U.S. presenting posters and going to conferences is strongly encouraged for graduate students (and even undergraduates!). But since I did my undergrad in the U.K., this wasn\u0026#8217;t an opportunity I\u0026#8217;d had before. And since the first two years of grad school were so full of coursework for me here, I didn\u0026#8217;t have the time to present before. I find it kind of funny that my first poster presentation ever is not even at an anthropology conference, but some things just work out that way, I guess ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.  The conference I went to is the International Conference on Environmental Ergonomics (ICEE for short). This is a conference that happens every other year and it\u0026#8217;s incredibly interdisciplinary with researchers who do mathematical modeling, to experimental physiologists and everything in between. And it\u0026#8217;s a very small conference! In total, I think there were only about 200 people attending, and there was only one session at a time. This is a huge contrast to the annual meeting for the American Association of Physical Anthropologists where you have thousands of people and 20 things going on at once. Having been to both a big and a small conference now, I can say with confidence that there are some clear benefits to going to a smaller conference! For the first time in my conferencing life (which consists of a grand total of 3 conferences), I was able to actually have meaningful conversations with multiple senior and junior academics. Usually, at a big conference, it\u0026#8217;s just so overwhelmingly crowded that it\u0026#8217;s intimidating to talk to people you don\u0026#8217;t know (especially as a graduate student). But by the end of this conference, I pretty much knew all the students, professors and other researchers who were there. This was in no small way facilitated by the fact that Dr. Kenney introduced me to everyone he knew there. Apparently, this is his M.O. for mentoring students. What can I say? I have been very lucky with the advisors that have come into my life. Yours truly at her poster. Thanks to Dr. Kenney and Dr. Havenith (and Dr. Jablonski!) my poster session went really well and I managed to get a lot of excellent feedback on my ideas. All of the conversations I had with people that day will definitely help me in putting together the best plan of action for tackling my research questions. Another awesome thing about this conference is that I got to meet with a lot of amazing students who are doing really exciting research. Meeting fellow students over beer and okonomiyaki is definitely a plus for this conference! A really important piece of advice that I’ve heard is: don’t just ‘network’ with professors, talk to other students.\nI couldn’t agree with this more. When you go to a conference, it’s a great opportunity to meet famous professors, yes, but the students you are seeing there are your future colleagues and collaborators, so don’t miss out on the opportunity to meet them too!\nI feel so incredibly lucky to have had my advisor’s support in going to this conference. Not only was it a great learning experience allowing me to meet Dr. Havenith in real life, but it was also in JAPAN!!!\nIt was my first time in Japan and, given that I have wanted to go there since I was about 14 years old, this was kind of a dream come true for me and I had to try really hard not to spend the whole week running around screaming “OMG I CAN’T BELIEVE I’M IN JAPAN ASDFJKLF!”\nLet me tell you, I took in as much of Kobe as I possibly could during that week and it was fantastic!\nThey had ready-made bubble tea in their convenience stores \u0026#8211; I was in heaven The city was beautiful. The only glitch in the whole thing was that I struggled with some of the customs a bit more than expected:\nI didn’t realize it would be so hard to do this polite Japanese bow thing properly 😭  Do you hinge from the hips like a deadlift?? And where should my eyes be looking???

When science is personal, it\u0026#8217;s more relatable and understandable To quote Henry Louis Gates Jr.: \u0026#8220;Kids love to study themselves\u0026#8221;. I\u0026#8217;m the kind of person who will take time out of their day to click on a headline that says: \u0026#8220;Answer these 7 questions and we\u0026#8217;ll tell you what flavor of donut your soul is\u0026#8221;. So, let\u0026#8217;s just say that I\u0026#8217;m a sucker for learning stuff about myself. And, clearly, I\u0026#8217;m not alone! When my advisor, Nina Jablonski, was telling me about this camp, she explained that the idea behind the genetics \u0026 genealogy camp was making science personally meaningful. When you are learning about yourself, you\u0026#8217;re invested and you\u0026#8217;re curious. And this summer, I saw that these young scientists were truly engaged with all of this material in an amazing way. Topics like DNA, evolution, and history were no longer a collection of abstract facts, but tools for these kids to answer questions they had about themselves. What I thought was really amazing about this particular camp was the combination of the genetics with the genealogy. Starting off by thinking about your grandparents and great-grandparents is a great way of showing that (human) evolution is just an extension of history. \n“Here, they called us scientists” – Adalynn\nWhen I heard this, it made me so happy that I nearly cried. Yes, I’m an emotional person. But seriously though, I’m a 25-year old Ph.D. student and this year was probably the first time a professor had referred to me as a scientist.\nLetting these kids know they were scientists was so empowering! I honestly think that just by doing that, they’ve been immunized against impostor syndrome (grad students know what I’m talking about, sadly….).\n The camp\u0026#8217;s amazing instructor, Brandon Ogbunu, made sure these kids knew _they_ were in charge and could do anything they set their minds to\u0026nbsp; Watching it all come together: Finding Your Roots – The Seedlings \nWhile I\u0026#8217;m still pretty salty that I couldn\u0026#8217;t be snuck in to participate as a slightly older, oversized child, watching the web series following this summer\u0026#8217;s camp is arguably the next best thing!

Last week\u0026#8217;s article on African skin color in _Science_ READ IT! It is great, well-written, and has amazing figures! I would actually show you some of those figures if I wasn\u0026#8217;t terrified of publishers coming after me for copyright infringement (look, I\u0026#8217;m trying to finish a Ph.D., here, so I don\u0026#8217;t have time to get sued by journal publishers\u0026#8230;). If you don\u0026#8217;t have access to these journals, hit up your nearest scholar and ask them for a copy (you can email me!). And one of the things I really appreciate in this article is that it\u0026#8217;s a study on variation in Africa that actually includes African authors from African institutions. This research is important. That\u0026#8217;s why it was picked up by The New York Times and The Atlantic. These articles are all full of people emphasizing that African diversity is an amazing thing that we need to pay attention to! Read both of those articles too because they are full of quotes that got me feeling some type of way:  “We knew quite a lot about why people have pale skin if they had European ancestry,” said Nicholas G. Crawford, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the new study. “But there was very little known about why people have dark skin.” – New York Times\n  Few human traits are more variable, more obvious, and more historically divisive than the color of our skin. And yet, for all its social and scientific importance, we know very little about how our genes influence its pigment. **What we do know comes almost entirely from studying people of European descent. **– Ed Yong via The Atlantic\n And there you have it, in bold, the reason I ended up doing a Ph.D. in biological anthropology. I wanted to know more about human biological variation, and I specifically wanted to focus on African diversity. Why is so much of the research on human trait variation focused on Europeans? I remember, as an undergraduate, hearing so many times that “Africans have the most genetic diversity” but when it came to looking at trait variation, especially skin color, hair color and hair form, all of a sudden, it was like Africans were just a monolith.\nI remember looking for articles on variation in African pigmentation and hair, but all I could find was dozens of articles on how Europeans had all of these \u0026#8216;diverse\u0026#8217; hair colors and hair types, but Africans could just be described as homogeneously \u0026#8220;dark\u0026#8221; and their hair was simply \u0026#8220;frizzy\u0026#8221;. Mind you, these are not articles from the 19th century, these are things that were published from 2000 onwards. Research saying that \u0026#8220;Africans have the most genetic diversity\u0026#8221; started to sound a lot like paying lip service without actually believing it. Looking at the 23andMe genetic testing results, I don\u0026#8217;t get the impression that we really respect the idea that \u0026#8220;Africans have the most genetic diversity\u0026#8221; because these are the reference populations for ancestry in Europeans vs Africans: I mean, you can tell me if I\u0026#8217;ve got \u0026#8220;Balkan\u0026#8221;, \u0026#8220;French \u0026 German\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;Finnish\u0026#8221; ancestry but the categories for Africa span a third of the continent? That\u0026#8217;s a problem. But at least, 23andMe is aware of it\u0026#8230; Why does \u0026#8220;the public\u0026#8221; believe skin color = race? Based on the titles of the news articles, you\u0026#8217;d think the problem is that everyone equates skin color with race. Headline from the New York Times Headline from Quartz Headline from Science Alert Headline from IFL Science From these headlines, I guess the question should be: \u0026#8220;Who believes race = skin color?\u0026#8221; Surely the Africans living in Africa and traveling around the continent would have noticed that there is a huge range of variation. Is this an American/European problem? Maybe this does indeed have something to do with who, historically, has designed the racial categories. When Linnaeus first divided humans up into subspecies, skin color was indeed one of the classifiers of the different \u0026#8216;human races\u0026#8217;. Linnaeus original classification of human \u0026#8216;variants\u0026#8217; But then again, despite decades of critiques, humans can still be categorized by racialized groups that use skin color as a classifier if we take a peek at the U.S. census categories: Currently on the U.S. census website. And, honestly, looking at the history of the terms, it\u0026#8217;s been worse. Yes, there is certainly a lag time between scientific consensus and public understanding. But the problem isn\u0026#8217;t just with \u0026#8220;the public\u0026#8221; understanding science, it\u0026#8217;s also a problem of the things that have been done in the name of science. Scientific \u0026#8216;objectivity\u0026#8217; doesn\u0026#8217;t mean the field of human biology gets a pass on diversity. Whenever I read about scientific racism, I inevitably come across some claim that the great thing about Science is that \u0026#8216;it\u0026#8217;s objective\u0026#8217; and that Science is self-correcting and will eventually uncover The Truth™. But the problem is the Science isn\u0026#8217;t some great force in the universe that just happens. Science is done by scientists, and who those scientists are matters. Some people genuinely believe that it doesn\u0026#8217;t matter who does science as long as it is done correctly The Truth™ will shine through. But that isn\u0026#8217;t necessarily true. No matter how perfect your application of the scientific method is (and, honestly, it rarely is applied perfectly), there is still room for bias. Just because the process of science is supposed to be objective, doesn\u0026#8217;t mean that the hypotheses we think up come from a place of objectivity. Hypotheses are inspired by what we see in the world around us, and that is fundamentally influenced by our perspectives and experiences. This bias in the hypotheses is especially obvious articles written about sexual selection in skin and hair color and almost everything you find will be about how \u0026#8216;white skin\u0026#8217; and \u0026#8216;blond hair\u0026#8217; evolved because these are attractive traits (with little to no evidence as to why that is so, just trust the author on this, obviously, this is a fact). This bias in hypotheses is undeniable in the fact that when we talk about the (pseudo)scientific work on \u0026#8216;racial\u0026#8217; differences in intelligence, it is always about the supposed superiority of \u0026#8216;white\u0026#8217; or \u0026#8216;European\u0026#8217; people. There is a very straightforward relationship between those who, historically, have done the science, and who comes out on top when \u0026#8216;scientists\u0026#8217; ask questions about what traits are attractive or superior. \u0026#8220;Scientific racism is a thing of the past\u0026#8221;  Just because the \u0026#8216;Annals of Eugenics\u0026#8217; has changed its name to the \u0026#8216;Annals of Human Genetics\u0026#8217; doesn\u0026#8217;t mean we\u0026#8217;ve undone centuries of scientific racism. Just because there have been hundreds of articles and books on scientific racism doesn\u0026#8217;t mean we\u0026#8217;ve overcome the systematic and structural problems that made it necessary for those articles and books to be written. Of course, there has been progress. Many scientists have called out racist work and, some, have even dedicated their lives to fighting scientific racism. For most of the biased hypotheses I mentioned above, there have been eloquent responses by other white researchers pointing out the flaws in those works and questioning the validity of hypotheses seeking to prove superiority. But why do we rely on white scientists to call out other white scientists? Why is science, especially the science of human biological variation, such a \u0026#8216;white space\u0026#8217;? A few years ago, James Watson clearly felt comfortable enough to say that \u0026#8216;Africans are less intelligent\u0026#8217;. The fact that he didn\u0026#8217;t expect the backlash should tell us something about the academic environment he had been living in until that point. The biggest structural problem in science today is that, in the most \u0026#8216;prestigious\u0026#8217; societies, institutions and journals (those that have the most power to construct the scientific narrative), it remains overrepresented by certain demographic groups (i.e. white, male, English-speaking), and underrepresented by others. This influences the kind of science that is done. And it most certainly influences the kind of bad science that slips through the cracks and the kind of biases that are shared behind closed doors. Diversity isn\u0026#8217;t just necessary for fighting \u0026#8216;scientific racism\u0026#8217;, it\u0026#8217;s necessary for improving the quality of science. Even with the best of intentions, scientists can perpetuate stereotypes. In the case of skin color, clearly, there have been a lot of researchers who could not see any the large variation on the darker end of the skin pigmentation spectrum. This is what I like to refer to as the \u0026#8217;50 shades of Beige\u0026#8217; problem. This is the reason why Rihanna\u0026#8217;s Fenty Beauty line of foundation has done so well \u0026#8211; Rihanna recognizes the wide range of skin colors that exist, especially on the darker end of the spectrum. Range of shades available for Rihanna\u0026#8217;s Fenty Beauty This is a contrast with companies that manufacture products for all the shades of light skin that exist, but apparently, believe that dark-skinned people are one uniform shade: Luckily for scientific work on skin color, we have machines that can measure skin color objectively (reflectance spectrophotometers), so we\u0026#8217;ve been able to quantify the great range of diversity that there has been for a while now. But despite the fact that there have been some researchers who\u0026#8217;ve pointed out this diversity for more than a decade, most of the research on skin color (and its genetics) has remained pretty focused on variation found in Western countries:  The first gene identified as affecting human skin color—MC1R—is very diverse in European populations but remarkably similar across African ones. Based on that pattern, says Tishkoff, some geneticists have concluded that the evolutionary pressure for dark skin in Africa is so strong that any genetic variants that altered skin color were ruthlessly weeded out by natural selection. “That’s not true,” says Tishkoff—but it’s what happens when you only study skin color in Western countries. “When you look at this African-centered perspective, there’s a lot of variation.” \u0026#8211; The Atlantic  We need an African-centered perspective. This is especially true in my area of study \u0026#8211; human hair diversity. Even with skin color, which we can measure objectively, there\u0026#8217;s been a bias in the research and homogenization of African variation, so just imagine for a second what the situation is like for hair variation, which we don\u0026#8217;t yet have good methods of measurement for. I can tell you, the situation is pretty bad. While people have suggested a number of ways of measuring hair curl, if you look for genetic studies of people\u0026#8217;s hair, what you\u0026#8217;ll find is that researchers simply categorize people\u0026#8217;s hair visually into: \u0026#8216;straight\u0026#8217;, \u0026#8216;wavy\u0026#8217; or \u0026#8216;curly\u0026#8217; \u0026#8211; and not so surprisingly, these studies focus on European hair variation. One of my favorite genetic studies on pigmentation and hair form uses a diverse group of Latin Americans, but guess what their categories are for hair curl? \u0026#8216;Straight\u0026#8217;, \u0026#8216;wavy\u0026#8217;, \u0026#8216;curly\u0026#8217; and \u0026#8216;frizzy\u0026#8217;. Like I said, even the best of intentions won\u0026#8217;t save you from the need for diversity. The Afro-descendant people in that study cohort probably had a range of hair textures and to reduce that variation to \u0026#8216;frizzy\u0026#8217; is not just problematic because it\u0026#8217;s an insulting term, it also homogenizes a group of diverse people using the hair equivalent of the \u0026#8217;50 shades of Beige\u0026#8217; approach. I understand the need to use categories if you have a huge amount of data and no good way to measure a trait. But there are options. And if there had been African or Afro-descendant women involved with the design of the study, I\u0026#8217;d think someone would have pointed out that for a few years now, there have been more sophisticated categorizations people with tightly curled hair use to describe their hair types: Think of all the scientific discoveries we are missing out on because we don\u0026#8217;t seek the perspectives of people who can see all of this variation. Hopefully, in a few years, we can do with hair what we have done for skin and then we can happily read articles telling us about the huge range of diversity in hair within Africa. Hopefully, in a few years, we won\u0026#8217;t be as \u0026#8216;surprised\u0026#8217; that Africans are not all the same. Again, I\u0026#8217;m very excited about the article that just came out and I will continue to share the hell out of it. “Africa is not some homogenous place where everyone has dark skin. There’s huge variation.” YES, @SarahTishkoff, TELL THEM!!! https://t.co/hsl3GciB0m  \u0026mdash; Tina Lasisi (@TinaLasisi) October 12, 2017  I just wish we weren\u0026#8217;t so surprised about African diversity, and I believe this \u0026#8216;surprise\u0026#8217; is related to the fact that even when Africans and Afro-descendants are the subjects of scientific interest, we are not often enough the ones shaping the work that is being done. Diversity in other areas of science and other types of diversity I\u0026#8217;ve kept this post centered on the biological anthropology/human biology aspect of science because that\u0026#8217;s the discipline I\u0026#8217;m familiar with. Of course, there are other areas in science that would benefit from diversity and there are excellent articles and posts about that from other people on e.g. astronomy, mathematics. Some excellent people to follow on this issue include the astrophysicists Chanda Prescod-Weinstein \u0026 Jedidah Isler, the biologist Danielle Lee and the podcasts VanguardSTEM and PhDivas. And here\u0026#8217;s another article on diversity in STEM just to get you going. Most of what I\u0026#8217;ve talked about here is the way in which black/African opinions would impact science, but it is important to include other underrepresented perspectives as well. These include (but are not limited to) perspectives from: non-English speakers (there\u0026#8217;s a whole world out there that\u0026#8217;s ignored because people can\u0026#8217;t publish in what happened to become the \u0026#8220;common\u0026#8221; language), non-Western people, people from non-industrialized societies, people who\u0026#8217;ve grown up in poverty, LGBTQ people \u0026#8211; all of these need to have a voice in science if we truly want to strive for excellence and innovation.

Last week\u0026#8217;s article on African skin color in _Science_ READ IT! It is great, well-written, and has amazing figures! I would actually show you some of those figures if I wasn\u0026#8217;t terrified of publishers coming after me for copyright infringement (look, I\u0026#8217;m trying to finish a Ph.D., here, so I don\u0026#8217;t have time to get sued by journal publishers\u0026#8230;). If you don\u0026#8217;t have access to these journals, hit up your nearest scholar and ask them for a copy (you can email me!). And one of the things I really appreciate in this article is that it\u0026#8217;s a study on variation in Africa that actually includes African authors from African institutions. This research is important. That\u0026#8217;s why it was picked up by The New York Times and The Atlantic. These articles are all full of people emphasizing that African diversity is an amazing thing that we need to pay attention to! Read both of those articles too because they are full of quotes that got me feeling some type of way:  “We knew quite a lot about why people have pale skin if they had European ancestry,” said Nicholas G. Crawford, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the new study. “But there was very little known about why people have dark skin.” – New York Times\n  Few human traits are more variable, more obvious, and more historically divisive than the color of our skin. And yet, for all its social and scientific importance, we know very little about how our genes influence its pigment. **What we do know comes almost entirely from studying people of European descent. **– Ed Yong via The Atlantic\n And there you have it, in bold, the reason I ended up doing a Ph.D. in biological anthropology. I wanted to know more about human biological variation, and I specifically wanted to focus on African diversity. Why is so much of the research on human trait variation focused on Europeans?

Before I actually started studying hair, I probably spent a good 20 years of my life not knowing anything about it. Clearly, I survived. So I\u0026#8217;m not gonna try and tell you that this is essential knowledge or something. BUT, knowing something about what hair actually is and how it grows may help you make more informed decisions about the way you cut/dye/pluck/wax/treat/do whatever to it! And (BONUS!) for those of you who want to understand the science of hair, a basic introduction to hair growth \u0026 anatomy will definitely come in handy. Think of this post as the \u0026#8216;How it\u0026#8217;s made\u0026#8216; of hair: Disclaimer: this is **_not_** how hair is made. I just really like this pasta making machine. _How it\u0026#8217;s made_ has excellent pasta GIFs, just saying. Really, the point of this post is to teach you the basics and answer questions like:  \u0026#8220;What is hair, even?\u0026#8221;   \u0026#8220;How does hair grow?\u0026#8221;   \u0026#8220;If I shave my mustache, will it grow back thicker? And if so, can I prep for Movember this way?\u0026#8221;   I don\u0026#8217;t know what your hair questions are\u0026#8230; I\u0026#8217;m just guessing here. But without further ado, let\u0026#8217;s get on with today\u0026#8217;s lesson! Overview of the stuff you\u0026#8217;re going to learn:  Hair is part of the integumentary system and it is an appendage on the skin.   There are two parts to \u0026#8220;hair\u0026#8221;: the hair shaft and the hair follicle.   The layers of the hair shaft are the cuticle, the cortex, and the medulla.   The hair shaft is produced by the hair follicle, a complex mini-organ in the skin.   The hair growth cycle has an anagen (growing), catagen (resting), telogen (shedding) phase.   (If you\u0026#8217;re really keen and want to read more, there are scientific references at the bottom that are cited throughout the post with little numbers)   What is hair even? The thing we call \u0026#8220;hair\u0026#8221; can more precisely be described as a keratinized appendage that grows out of a mini-organ in the skin called a hair follicle.1 And now, a longer explanation in less fancy language: Some of you may know that skin is the largest organ in your body (well, I guess on your body is more accurate). But did you know that there are organs within this organ??? One might say, there\u0026#8217;s layers to this. Your skin is part of the integumentary system. The integumentary system is an organ system like the circulatory system and the nervous system etc. In these organ systems, a bunch of different organs work together to do stuff. The integumentary system is made up of skin and its appendages (i.e. the stuff that sticks out of it). For humans, this includes mainly hair and nails, but if you have a more avian or reptilian inclination, feathers and scales are also important appendages. Hair and nails are keratinized structures. This means that the cells from which they came have become filled with keratin (a tough protein) and have died in the process. And as a little bonus did-you-know, integument comes from the Latin integumentum, which means \u0026#8220;cover\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;enclosure\u0026#8221;. Perfect name for the stuff that keeps our insides from spilling out! The hair shaft \u0026#8211; the thing we usually think of when we talk about hair When we talk about hair, we usually mean the stringy stuff that\u0026#8217;s growing out of our bodies \u0026#8211; the hair shaft. But this is only half the story! If we really want to understand how hair works, we also have to talk about where this stringy stuff grows, which is the hair follicle. BUT, first things first, the hair shaft that we are all so familiar with, is actually not a simple fiber! The hair shaft is frequently described as having three main parts (from outside to inside): a cuticle, a cortex, and a medulla.  The cuticle is the outermost layer which is often described as consisting of scale-like structures that cover the hair fiber like tiles on a roof.   The cortex represents the majority of the hair and is made up of keratin bundles that form long and fiber-like structures (filaments).   The medulla is the innermost part which is essentially made up of empty space (more specifically, vacuolated cells). It may often be discontinuous or even missing in hair fibers.2   The hair follicle \u0026#8211; the thing that actually makes your hair The hair follicle is the mini-organ which produces the hair shaft. Essentially, it is the pasta machine to our spaghetti: I honestly didn\u0026#8217;t realize how relevant pasta-making GIFs were to hair\u0026#8230; However, a slightly more accurate biological depiction might look like this:  The hair shaft exits the hair follicle through the epidermis (the top layer of your skin).   The sebaceous gland (produces oil in the hair follicle) and the arrector pili muscle (responsible for ‘raising your hair’ when you get goosebumps) are also associated with the hair follicle.   The inner root sheath (IRS) consists of a cuticle, Henle and Huxley layer these are involved in shaping the hair3. The outer root sheath (ORS) is the outermost part of the hair follicle and the ‘bulge’ is a thickened portion of the ORS where some stem cells of the hair follicle are found.   At the bottom of the hair follicle, we find the portion known as the hair bulb. It contains the dermal papilla which is essential for signaling in the hair growth cycle 4. The matrix surrounding the dermal papilla is full of proliferative (dividing) cells which differentiate into the various layers of the hair mentioned above (medulla, cortex, cuticle, and IRS) 5.   So, as the cells of the matrix divide, older cells are pushed upwards by newer ones. At a certain point, these cells reach the keratogenous zone which is where the cells of the hair shaft keratinize and become hard and dead.   As you just learnt, once your hair is out of the follicle, it\u0026#8217;s dead, so whatever you do to the hair shaft (e.g. cutting/shaving) won\u0026#8217;t have any effect on the hair growing underneath. So there\u0026#8217;s also no point in covering your hair with avocados and bananas for the healthy minerals and vitamins! (Although you\u0026#8217;ll probably smell like a delicious smoothie!) And, if you trim your hair often because you think it will grow faster, I\u0026#8217;m sure you\u0026#8217;re feeling pretty scammed right about now. Real footage of a hairdresser telling you that your hair will grow faster if you just come have it trimmed with her every 3 weeks. But if you wanna give your awesome hair follicles some love as they do the hard work of producing those hair fibers, go for it! The hair growth cycle \u0026#8211; the circle of life, but for hair Now, this is the part where I ruin your dreams of becoming Rapunzel. If you\u0026#8217;ve been avoiding cutting your hair for years and years because you\u0026#8217;re hoping to reach fairytale princess/metalhead lengths, you may be disappointed to learn that your hair will not grow forever. Still waiting for someone to propose long hair evolved because of sexual selection on metalheads. Your hair grows in a cycle! This means it doesn\u0026#8217;t grow forever, but it grows for a while, then stops, then falls out. Luckily, human hairs aren\u0026#8217;t synced up, or you would have awkward moments of hairlessness every now and then\u0026#8230; But the hair growth cycle for scalp hair looks something like this:  During anagen (growth), the matrix cells are proliferating and keratinizing as they move up – the hair grows. The duration of this phase is variable among people, but it is usually about 4-6 years for scalp hair. While human hair does grow asynchronously (which means hairs in the same region may be at different points in the growth cycle), about 90% of the hair will usually be at some point in the anagen phase.   During catagen (resting), the cells stop proliferating and programmed cell death begins to destroy the lower (cycling) part of the hair follicle. The matrix hardens and the hair follicle is loosely attached to the dermal papilla (which you will remember is a mesodermal derivative, unlike the rest of the hair follicle). This phase only lasts a few weeks.   In the telogen (shedding) phase, the hair follicle is not doing much and the hair is just waiting to be shed (which can take around 4-6 months)6.   The anagen phase is reinitiated by signaling between the ‘bulge’ (in the permanent portion of the hair follicle) and the dermal papilla, prompting the growth of a new hair bulb and restarting the entire process3.   So if you glanced over the hair growth cycle chart, you may have gotten worried for a second that your eyebrows and leg hair are growing for years. Don\u0026#8217;t worry, they have much shorter growth cycles! Scalp hair has the longest duration of hair growth on the body. Other hair on the body has shorter cycles and there\u0026#8217;s quite a bit of variation in the duration of different parts of the cycle depending on the region of the body and on the individual \u0026#8211; but that\u0026#8217;s a story for another time! That was it: the beginner\u0026#8217;s guide to hair growth \u0026 anatomy! So, out of curiosity, did you know any of this? Or was this all new to you? Are there any other (science) questions/shower thoughts you\u0026#8217;ve had about hair? Please share them in the comments so I can make sure I give you some answers in future blog posts!

Kind of joking, kind of not. I seriously have been wondering about the best way to introduce this blog (but that\u0026#8217;s not all I\u0026#8217;ve been doing for three years, don\u0026#8217;t worry, there\u0026#8217;s plenty more I worried about). However, it\u0026#8217;s been 3 years, and it is comical at this point so I would like to share a distillation of the most important life lessons I have learnt while procrastinating this blog for few years: 1 . My to-do list is infinitely long, it\u0026#8217;s growing exponentially, and tasks are not exactly getting crossed off. I remember when Facebook introduced the \u0026#8220;save\u0026#8221; button function. I. LOVED. IT. I remember thinking \u0026#8220;Wow, this is so useful! Now my workflow won\u0026#8217;t get interrupted by super interesting articles because I can just save them for later! Brilliant!\u0026#8221; Cue reality\u0026#8230;. This is who I am as a person and I have to come to terms with it. It\u0026#8217;s honestly all done with the *intention* of actually reading/watching it, but I just never find the time! My expectation was that I would somehow magically stop going through Facebook\u0026#8217;s endless scroll (yeah, sure\u0026#8230;) and THEN on a regular basis check my saved posts, read them and tick them off in an organized manner. What actually happened was that I just kept on scrolling (endless scroll will do that to you\u0026#8230;) and saving, scrolling, saving, scrolling, saving \u0026#8211; until I was jolted upright by some kind of reminder of an immediate deadline or the realization that 3 hours had passed and I\u0026#8217;d done literally nothing but Facebook my life away. Funny thing is, I started noticing this happened not just with Facebook, but with everything. I *love* me a to-do list. Mmmmm, good stuff! Pen and paper, app-based, check boxes on Evernote/Word. Doesn\u0026#8217;t matter \u0026#8211; love \u0026#8217;em all! Once it\u0026#8217;s on your to-do list, it\u0026#8217;s basically already done and you can chill! It makes me feel so organized. Like, look at it, there is a physical representation of all my good intentions! And we all know ah-MAY-zingly that works, right? (see all previous New Year\u0026#8217;s resolutions for reference) The problem was that my little to-do list habit was covering up a bigger issue underneath: I spent a lot more time\nthinking about the stuff I was going to do than actually doing the stuff I wanted to do.\nAnd it didn\u0026#8217;t matter what area of my life I was focusing on, this was an issue everywhere. Blog? Man, I have ideas for so many posts! I\u0026#8217;m gonna write about this, that and oooh, this would be really great, and what about\u0026#8230; Academic work? Can\u0026#8217;t start writing this yet, duh! Gotta think up MORE options! We could do A) B), or even better C). No, actually, what about Χ, Ψ, Ω. Or wait, you know what would be an absolutely fascinating approach???? (⑅∫°ਊ°)∫ Dude, even MEAL PREP! \u0026#8220;What should I eat this week?\u0026#8221; But, in the end, no choices are made, there\u0026#8217;s no food and I\u0026#8217;m hangry. You get it, it was an all-around issue. But every time I became aware of what was going on for a split second, I had an excuse. I wasn\u0026#8217;t *really* procrastinating, I was just full of ideas! From the waitbutwhy.com post on procrastination But you can\u0026#8217;t *just* be an ideas person. You\u0026#8217;ve gotta actually do stuff. When you add to that perfectionism (which a lot of people struggle with in academia), nothing ever gets done, yet every moment is stressful as hell (double fun!). Sometimes I tried to get around it by focusing on smaller tasks. But a lot of times, those smaller tasks just turned into me focusing on details at the expense of the big picture. (Bruv, do you know how much time I spent thinking and rethinking the title of my blog? The subtitle, the potential categories, color schemes, tags, pages etc??? Yeah\u0026#8230;.) My mom used to tell me that in Bulgaria they had a small story about this type of attitude: \u0026#8220;Ah, these buttons are perfect! Now, all I need is the coat for them to be sewn onto!\u0026#8221;  Okay, look, it might\u0026#8217;ve been funnier in Bulgarian\u0026#8230; and when my mom told it. Or maybe it\u0026#8217;s not funny at all\u0026#8230;But you get the point! I wish I could say that I eventually found an easy solution or system for getting through your to-do lists, but I haven\u0026#8217;t\u0026#8230; However, I\u0026#8217;ve gotten better at it by accepting that you\u0026#8217;ve gotta start somewhere. Just pick a thing. Then do the thing. Yeah, there are other things you could do, other ideas you might have, but you have to spend most of your time actually doing the things you want to do instead of dreaming about the things you want to do. If it seems important, write it down for later. If it\u0026#8217;s not, finish what you are doing and stop double-guessing yourself; you can think about it later. Doing what you can is a lot more satisfying than dwelling on what you could. And even when you \u0026#8220;understand\u0026#8221; this, it takes practice to apply it, but eventually, your habits improve and that\u0026#8217;s good enough. (But on a side note, I\u0026#8217;m like 100% sure that if I had just a few more weeks this blog would be a million times better, but I\u0026#8217;m scared that my friends might actually handcuff me and press the publish button for me if I procrastinate any longer, but, other than that, I totally learnt my lesson, I swear\u0026#8230;) 2 . Everything takes SO MUCH LONGER to do than you think and NOTHING goes according to plan. What\u0026#8217;s the reading time for this blog post? 13 minutes. What\u0026#8217;s the writing time for this blog post? Well, lemme tell you it\u0026#8217;s not 13 minutes. To be honest, I\u0026#8217;m not sure exactly how long it took me to write this. But roughly, 3-4 hours, not counting \u0026#8220;thinking time\u0026#8221; beforehand, previous rough drafts, and editing time afterward. (And being that this point was written about halfway through the post, it means I actually had to go back to edit this estimate.) Does this mean I spent those hours typing non-stop? Nope. How many bathroom breaks, food breaks, tea breaks, staring-at-the-space-around-my-desk breaks does include??? Who knows!? But did that stop me from wanting to plan out exactly how this was going to go? You bet your pretty lil face it didn\u0026#8217;t! Along with a deep love of to-do lists (see point 1), I also have very strong feelings about timetables. Again, whether I write them out super neatly, type them up on Word or have a beautiful color-coded iCloud calendar or even a scheduling app, it doesn\u0026#8217;t matter \u0026#8211; I love all of it! I mean, clearly, the solution to all of life\u0026#8217;s problems and the key to success is planning out every little thing as it *should* happen. Why would you not plan meticulously? It\u0026#8217;s fool-proof! If you just write down what\u0026#8217;s gonna happen; then that\u0026#8217;s what\u0026#8217;s gonna happen, BOOM! \u0026#8220;Fail to plan and you plan to fail\u0026#8221; is a cliché for a reason! When I finished my first year as an undergraduate, I thought that by now I would have solved the question of human hair diversity and have moved onto a brief stint in the UN to finally achieve world peace before spending a few years mastering Kung Fu at a Shaolin monastery after which I would just travel the world and learn a couple language (you know, just in case I got bored). By the first year of graduate school, I had readjusted that plan to something I thought was more realistic. I thought that by the beginning of year 3 I would have learnt ALL OF THE GENETICS, a decent amount of Chemistry, and of course, my dissertation would be half written and I would have had this blog published ages ago. Lol, nope, not even that. Really long term plans are no use. Hopes, aspirations, yes. But actual, concrete plans, not so much\u0026#8230; Even in the shorter term, you often have to readjust your course as you get new information. E.g. Really important realization on my part: I will never learn \u0026#8220;ALL THE GENETICS\u0026#8221; because even geneticists don\u0026#8217;t know all of the genetics. No one does. It\u0026#8217;s kind of unknowable. Very much a case of \u0026#8216;the more you know, the less you know\u0026#8217;. And a big problem is that a lot of these \u0026#8220;goals\u0026#8221; that I had were very broad and vague. (Laugh at me if you will, but honestly, at the time it seemed like a completely reasonable, doable plan). In the end, realistic goals for grad school were set with the help of my advisor and the graduate handbook that we have. What is a realistic goal?  Pass class X in the fall semester.   Take exam Y in the spring.   Write proposal Z by deadline A.   Those are some realistic goals. But I, being who I am, tried to plan those out more precisely too! Forget the syllabus, make your own!!! I can do all of the things and then more! Do all of these extra things and make a daily plan!!! (Again, sounded much better in my head at the time) This meme from hyporboleandahalf.com is always relevant in my life. Does that mean your only choice is to abandon any attempt to plan or schedule? No, With time, I have understood that the necessity to plan things falls on a spectrum from things that have a LOW need for planning and you can be very flexible about tothings that have a HIGH need for planning and you must be strict about. And it\u0026#8217;s not just a single universal scale. It\u0026#8217;s a scale that each person must construct for themselves (depending on their priorities) and it can be constructed for many different types of situations. For example\u0026#8230; Exam prep: Low \u0026#8211; break times while studying, shows to watch as a distraction, beverages to drink while relaxing studying\u0026#8230;. Medium \u0026#8211; How much time to spend on various exam topics. Study material. High \u0026#8211; WHERE IS THE EXAM?! WHAT TIME? HOW DO I GET THERE?! (capitalization and punctuation are to emphasize level of freaking out which is appropriate if you fail to plan these things) But equally, one can imagine that such a template can be applied to something like planning a holiday\u0026#8230; Low \u0026#8211; what routes to walk through the city, what sights to see, what time to wake up\u0026#8230; Medium \u0026#8211; A few food stands/restaurants you definitely don\u0026#8217;t want to miss. Location and times for museums or shows you want to see. Medium-High \u0026#8211; How to hit up every Krispy Kreme on the way to the final destination?! Are we sure Hot Krispy notifications are ready to alert on phone at all times!?!!! High \u0026#8211; WHAT TIME IS FLIGHT?! WHAT GATE AND AIRPORT IS IT AT?! Like I said, these scales are highly personal and context specific\u0026#8230;\n3 . Knowing when to turn to others for help is more important than you might imagine. No one succeeds on their own. This is why awards have acceptance speeches featuring thank yous; this is why books and papers have acknowledgment sections. Of course, you can and should work hard. But not everything you have and achieve can be purely through your own efforts. There\u0026#8217;s parents and caregivers who raise you (a category that features prominently in acknowledgments!). Teachers and professors who help you learn skills and guide you to the knowledge that you need to achieve your goals. Friends who help you deal with life and hold you accountable when that\u0026#8217;s what you need. And countless other acquaintances and strangers that hold visible and invisible roles in your life. Humans, as a species, are pretty hopeless as individuals. Without going on an Anthropology 101 tangent, there\u0026#8217;s a reason why studying the history of humans makes you so humble to the importance of cooperation. Without humans doing different tasks and coordinating with each other, there would be a pretty big limit on the things you could do on your own. All I know is that if I had to worry about literal survival every day, finding food and shelter\u0026#8230;. well, I\u0026#8217;d have even less time to write my doctoral thesis\u0026#8230; But I\u0026#8217;m not writing all these cheesy, emotional, mushy things just to emphasize the importance of gratitude. Gratitude is important, yes. But realizing that you are already getting help should make it easier to seek it out when you need it. For whatever reason, asking for help can be very difficult. Sometimes it\u0026#8217;s because you feel like you should be able to do it all on your own, otherwise, it\u0026#8217;s cheating or you don\u0026#8217;t deserve it. Sometimes it\u0026#8217;s because you\u0026#8217;re afraid you\u0026#8217;ll be a burden. And the struggle to ask for help is kind of how writing this blog and going to grad school came about for me. Towards the end of 2014, due to some unforeseen circumstances, I did not have the funds that I needed to complete my applications to grad school. I was short on time and there was no way I could get another job/pay check, credit card or loan before the deadlines. So I decided to start a little crowdfund. Reluctantly. Like, really reluctantly. On the inside, I was sooooooooo not into the idea. I was scared. Embarrassed. Terrified of what people might say\u0026#8230; \u0026#8220;Why doesn\u0026#8217;t she just ask her parents?\u0026#8221; \u0026#8220;Why didn\u0026#8217;t she think ahead?\u0026#8221; \u0026#8220;She doesn\u0026#8217;t deserve it, she\u0026#8217;s irresponsible\u0026#8221; \u0026#8220;Her work is not that interesting or important; why would I help her?\u0026#8221; \u0026#8220;She should just find a job, earn money, and apply next year\u0026#8221; But I just shoved all those negative thoughts into a box and tried anyway because somewhere, deep inside, under 569 layers of insecurity, I kind of thought my project might be interesting enough for some people to help me do it (does that sound too confident?). So, seeing this as my only shot, I went ahead and asked for help. And to my surprise, a lot of people responded positively! When I posted about it on Facebook and Tumblr, a lot of my friends donated. A lot of them shared. And then donations and messages even started coming in from people I had never met! I couldn\u0026#8217;t believe that so many people believed me and, not only that, they believed in me and my ability to get into grad school and be successful. With the help of all those people, not to mention the friends and mentors who helped me write and re-write my applications, professors who took the time to write letters of recommendation and advise me, and random people who posted resources for the GREs online; I got into grad school. It\u0026#8217;s still hard to turn to others. I want to work hard; I don\u0026#8217;t expect any hand-holding. There\u0026#8217;s still a little pride in that; there\u0026#8217;s still a little fear. But I try to be realistic about when I can\u0026#8217;t do something alone. And I know that if I ask for help, there will be people out there willing to be there for me. I feel very lucky to have gotten where I am now, and there are a lot of people who I feel I can never repay for their help. So, whenever I can, I try to pay it forward. In some way, I\u0026#8217;m hoping this blog can be a way of paying it forward. If there are people out there who supported me because they want to know about the things I research, then this will be a chance to inform them. If there are people who want to know what it\u0026#8217;s like to be in grad school and how to deal with certain issues that go along with that, hopefully, I can write something of use to them. And if there is anyone who can tolerate my sense of humor, who knows, maybe I can make them laugh???? Anyhow, this concludes my introductory post and you can look forward to the first hair science post next week. But to keep you entertained until then, you can have a look at what to expect from this blog, more details about my research, and the story of how I ended up doing a PhD on human hair diversity. P.S. I would really recommend the posts on procrastination on waitbutwhy.com \u0026#8211; they were probably the most helpful thing I found while I was procrastinating by googling \u0026#8220;how to stop procrastinating\u0026#8221; a few years ago. (Here\u0026#8217;s part 1 and part 2) [blog_subscription_form] ","date":1504716227,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504716227,"objectID":"c82a4155c0a832a370f0c6d00619a798","permalink":"/2017/09/06/remember-me/","publishdate":"2017-09-06T16:43:47Z","relpermalink":"/2017/09/06/remember-me/","section":"post","summary":"Reading time: 13 mins (2678 words) What better way to introduce a blog than by telling you all the ways in which I messed up? Kind of joking, kind of not. I seriously have been wondering about the best way to introduce this blog (but that\u0026#8217;s not all I\u0026#8217;ve been doing for three years, don\u0026#8217;t worry, there\u0026#8217;s plenty more I worried about). However, it\u0026#8217;s been 3 years, and it is comical at this point so I would like to share a distillation of the most important life lessons I have learnt while procrastinating this blog for few years: 1 . My to-do list is infinitely long, it\u0026#8217;s growing exponentially, and tasks are not exactly getting crossed off. I remember when Facebook introduced the \u0026#8220;save\u0026#8221; button function. I. LOVED. IT. I remember thinking \u0026#8220;Wow, this is so useful! Now my workflow won\u0026#8217;t get interrupted by super interesting articles because I can just save them for later! Brilliant!\u0026#8221; Cue reality\u0026#8230;. This is who I am as a person and I have to come to terms with it. It\u0026#8217;s honestly all done with the *intention* of actually reading/watching it, but I just never find the time! My expectation was that I would somehow magically stop going through Facebook\u0026#8217;s endless scroll (yeah, sure\u0026#8230;) and THEN on a regular basis check my saved posts, read them and tick them off in an organized manner. What actually happened was that I just kept on scrolling (endless scroll will do that to you\u0026#8230;) and saving, scrolling, saving, scrolling, saving \u0026#8211; until I was jolted upright by some kind of reminder of an immediate deadline or the realization that 3 hours had passed and I\u0026#8217;d done literally nothing but Facebook my life away. Funny thing is, I started noticing this happened not just with Facebook, but with everything. I *love* me a to-do list. Mmmmm, good stuff! Pen and paper, app-based, check boxes on Evernote/Word. Doesn\u0026#8217;t matter \u0026#8211; love \u0026#8217;em all! Once it\u0026#8217;s on your to-do list, it\u0026#8217;s basically already done and you can chill! It makes me feel so organized. Like, look at it, there is a physical representation of all my good intentions! And we all know ah-MAY-zingly that works, right?

It is one of the defining features of mammals, serving important functions, such as thermoregulation and endothermy. Among mammals, humans are exceptional in lacking a full covering of body hair. Instead the growth of terminal hairs is limited to specific body regions, such as the scalp, axillae, and groin. Our aim in this chapter is to provide an overview of the anthropology of human scalp hair. We will explore approaches to the study of variation in human scalp hair phenotypes, as well as the genetic and evolutionary basis of this diversity. The biology of human scalp hair, with emphasis on quantitative and qualitative differences among populations, as well as impact on hair grooming practices will also be discussed.","tags":[],"title":"The Anthropology of Human Scalp Hair","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
