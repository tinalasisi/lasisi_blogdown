 abstract = {Hair is predominantly a proteinaceous fiber that originates from
hair follicles located within the subcutis and/or dermis of the
skin. It is one of the defining features of mammals, serving
important functions, such as thermoregulation and endothermy.
Among mammals, humans are exceptional in lacking a full covering
of body hair. Instead the growth of terminal hairs is limited to
specific body regions, such as the scalp, axillae, and groin.
Our aim in this chapter is to provide an overview of the
anthropology of human scalp hair. We will explore approaches to
the study of variation in human scalp hair phenotypes, as well
as the genetic and evolutionary basis of this diversity. The
biology of human scalp hair, with emphasis on quantitative and
qualitative differences among populations, as well as impact on
hair grooming practices will also be discussed.},
