              methods of measuring variation in scalp hair fiber shape and
              pigmentation and carry out exploratory data analysis on a limited
              sample of individuals from diverse populations in order to inform
              future avenues of research for the evolution of modern human hair
              variation. METHODS: Cross-sectional area and shape and average
              curvature of scalp hair fibers were quantified using ImageJ.
              Pigmentation was analyzed using chemical methods estimating total
              melanin content through spectrophotometric methods, and eumelanin
              and pheomelanin content through HLPC analysis of melanin-specific
              degradation products. RESULTS: The initial results reinforced
              findings from earlier, traditional studies. African and African
              Diaspora scalp hair was significantly curled, (East) Asian hair
              was significantly thick, and European hair was significantly
              lighter in color. However, pigmentation analyses revealed a high
              level of variability in the melanin content of non-European
              populations and analysis of curvature found a large range of
              variation in the average curvature of East African individuals.
              CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest the usefulness of
              chemical methods for the elucidation of nonperceptible
              differences in scalp hair color and highlight the need for
              improvements in our assessment and understanding of hair fiber
              curvature. Am J Phys Anthropol 160:341-352, 2016. \copyright{}
