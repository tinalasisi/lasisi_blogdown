 abstract = {Like many highly variable human traits, more than a dozen genes
are known to contribute to the full range of skin color. However,
the historical bias in favor of genetic studies in European and
European-derived populations has blinded us to the magnitude of
pigmentation's complexity. As deliberate efforts are being made
to better characterize diverse global populations and new
sequencing technologies, better measurement tools, functional
assessments, predictive modeling, and ancient DNA analyses become
more widely accessible, we are beginning to appreciate how
limited our understanding of the genetic bases of human skin
color have been. Novel variants in genes not previously linked to
pigmentation have been identified and evidence is mounting that
there are hundreds more variants yet to be found. Even for genes
that have been exhaustively characterized in European populations
like MC1R, OCA2, and SLC24A5, research in previously understudied
groups is leading to a new appreciation of the degree to which
genetic diversity, epistatic interactions, pleiotropy, admixture,
global and local adaptation, and cultural practices operate in
population-specific ways to shape the genetic architecture of
skin color. Furthermore, we are coming to terms with how factors
like tanning response and barrier function may also have
influenced selection on skin throughout human history. By
examining how our knowledge of pigmentation genetics has shifted
in the last decade, we can better appreciate how far we have come
in understanding human diversity and the still long road ahead
for understanding many complex human traits.},
