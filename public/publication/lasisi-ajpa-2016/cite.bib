 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the use of quantitative
methods of measuring variation in scalp hair fiber shape and
pigmentation and carry out exploratory data analysis on a limited
sample of individuals from diverse populations in order to inform
future avenues of research for the evolution of modern human hair
variation. METHODS: Cross-sectional area and shape and average
curvature of scalp hair fibers were quantified using ImageJ.
Pigmentation was analyzed using chemical methods estimating total
melanin content through spectrophotometric methods, and eumelanin
and pheomelanin content through HLPC analysis of melanin-specific
degradation products. RESULTS: The initial results reinforced
findings from earlier, traditional studies. African and African
Diaspora scalp hair was significantly curled, (East) Asian hair
was significantly thick, and European hair was significantly
lighter in color. However, pigmentation analyses revealed a high
level of variability in the melanin content of non-European
populations and analysis of curvature found a large range of
variation in the average curvature of East African individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest the usefulness of
chemical methods for the elucidation of nonperceptible
differences in scalp hair color and highlight the need for
improvements in our assessment and understanding of hair fiber
curvature. Am J Phys Anthropol 160:341-352, 2016. o̧pyright
