      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#808080;&#34;&gt;Estimated reading time: 4 mins  (647 words)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I asked what ‘March Mammal Madness’ was, the answer I got was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;You know, it&amp;#8217;s like March Madness, but with mammals&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to which I eloquently replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s a march madness?&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2369&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2369&#34; style=&#34;width: 270px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2369 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy&#34; width=&#34;270&#34; height=&#34;204&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2369&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;#foreignkid&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to me currently being well-versed in the US sports, allow me to explain for those of you unfamiliar with the concept of a “March Madness” (mammalian or otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March Madness is the nickname for the university-level basketball tournament that is held annually during March (and a little bit of April; see &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament#March_Madness&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Wikipedia &lt;/a&gt;or your local sports encyclopedia for details).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hype around this is that people gamble by filling in these “brackets” that predict who will win during these face-offs and advance to the next round and ultimately become the champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2366&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2366&#34; style=&#34;width: 1042px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2366 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/real-bracket.png&#34; alt=&#34;real bracket&#34; width=&#34;1042&#34; height=&#34;808&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2366&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;See for reference a &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; bracket for this years basketball&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the deal with March &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mammal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Madness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, imagine if instead of basketball teams you had mammals battling against each other like Pokémon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2367&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2367&#34; style=&#34;width: 708px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2367 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/pokemon.png&#34; alt=&#34;pokemon&#34; width=&#34;708&#34; height=&#34;484&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2367&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Replace Blastoise &amp; Charizard with actual mammals and you get the drift&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to March Mammal Madness (or MMM for the cool kids) when Prof. Katie Hinde came to give a colloquium talk about her awesome research on lactation (watch her explain her work in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ted.com/talks/katie_hinde_what_we_don_t_know_about_mother_s_milk?utm_campaign=tedspread&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=tedcomshare&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;this Ted talk&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2370&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2370&#34; style=&#34;width: 720px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2370 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/katie.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Katie&#34; width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;509&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2370&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Dr. Katie Hinde, aka El Jefe, aka the mastermind behind March Mammal Madness&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though she came to talk about milk, the first question she got after the talk came from the daughter of two of our professors and it was about an upset in the 2016 MMM tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This girl came with all the facts about why her mammal should have been the one to win and she was essentially asking Prof. Hinde to explain herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was impressed and intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that day, I’ve learnt that since MMM started in 2013 it’s grown into a huge event with &lt;a href=&#34;http://mammalssuck.blogspot.com/2018/02/march-mammal-madness-2018.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;dozens of people&lt;/a&gt; contributing to the artwork and the logistics of the tournament, and thousands of people (&lt;a href=&#34;https://rochestertalon.com/8073/feature/block-science-students-participate-in-march-mammal-madness/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;of all ages&lt;/a&gt;) making brackets and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcadamlab.ca/news/2018/4/1/march-mammal-madness-2018&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;writing &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal_March_Madness&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;about &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/ct-mammal-march-madness-brotman-talk-0309-20150307-column.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;the madness&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

    My 13 and 11 year-old cousins filled out their own &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/2018MMM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#2018MMM&lt;/a&gt; brackets while I was visiting. What a great way to teach natural history and think critically while having fun! These are all their own picks. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/teamtardigrade?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#teamtardigrade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/bu5xUFaUXo&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/bu5xUFaUXo&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal_March_Madness&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lWLMgSz1kJmZP2DYAok21BlGZTThH-84/view&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;French version of the bracket&lt;/a&gt; – this is FOR REAL, Y’ALL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Twitter is where the real action happens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/2018MMMletsgo&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/2018MMMletsgo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between this year’s @2018MMMletsgo account and Prof. Katie Hinde’s own twitter, you can get all the news you need on MMM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-width=&#34;550&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;

    You know what y&#39;all- &lt;br /&gt;it&#39;s March 1st in Australia AND on the United States East Coast&amp;#8230; &lt;br /&gt;YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!?!? &lt;br /&gt;BRACKET DROP!&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/2018MMM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#2018MMM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/77I9P4Mq4o&#34;&gt;https://t.co/77I9P4Mq4o&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/cqGBl1vENu&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/cqGBl1vENu&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as much as I love all the accidental learning I do through March Mammal Madness, I have to be honest, I’m in it for a few main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distraction from not-fun work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trash-talking people in my department&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the memes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(in that order)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who do MMM are funny. Fact.&lt;/p&gt;

    None of these battle outcomes have been at all controverisal. Some are saying they are the best MMM narrations of all time &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/truth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#truth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/2018MMM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#2018MMM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/MjeaJWnBgE&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/MjeaJWnBgE&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let me tell you a little something about my department: we love MMM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the people’s office doors and hallways right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have our own Penn State MMM hashtag (and mailing list) led by Kate Lesciotto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-width=&#34;550&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EffinBirds?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@EffinBirds&lt;/a&gt; was prepared for this &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/2018MMM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#2018MMM&lt;/a&gt; moment &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MMMPSU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#MMMPSU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/YiKIKDEUMb&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/YiKIKDEUMb&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;mdash; Kate Lesciotto (@KateLesciotto) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KateLesciotto/status/979536223449632771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the center of the action at Penn State is (unfortunately) around my fellow grad student (and MMM archnemesis) Kevin Flaherty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-width=&#34;550&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p lang=&#34;und&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/Hp0nplVe4h&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Hp0nplVe4h&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;mdash; Kevin Flaherty (@kvflaherty) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kvflaherty/status/979543789902729216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, things were looking up. Both Kate (who shares a lab with Kevin) and I were pummeling his bracket at the beginning. And we weren’t nice about it either…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-2375&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/kevin.png&#34; alt=&#34;kevin&#34; width=&#34;551&#34; height=&#34;795&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-width=&#34;550&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
    It&#39;s just a game and its all in fun. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/dQNTBuTYVT&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/dQNTBuTYVT&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;mdash; Kevin Flaherty (@kvflaherty) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kvflaherty/status/976661786979160064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March 22, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, my foolish, foolish habit of always rooting for the primates *no matter what* finally caught up to me (and I’m not sure why Kate’s bracket went bust, but it did).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin certainly did not hold back after that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-width=&#34;550&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p lang=&#34;und&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, as we prepare for the 2018 MMM Final (and the dying breath of my busted bracket), I want to take a moment to thank #teamMMM for all their hard work this year, and a moment of appreciation the tardigrade for being the (non-mammalian) breakout star from this bracket – may the tardigrade be with us for many memes to come:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-width=&#34;550&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#808080;&#34;&gt;Estimated reading time: 22 mins (4349 words)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  One of the great joys of grad school is that exams are not just restricted to coursework.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Nope, PhD students get to go through the fun of taking an exam that determines whether they actually get to stay in grad school. Yay!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Since a few of my very close friends in grad school are preparing to go through this cruel, yet inescapable, rite of passage, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to write up all the tips I can think of to help them out on their journey.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  In my exceedingly finite wisdom, I have conjured up a list of 5-ish steps to passing comprehensive exams in grad school.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Since I just took these a year ago, the (painful) experience is still very much a recent memory, so this seems as good a time as any to pass on the knowledge I have gained to the next batch of students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Now, you may be wondering why I&amp;#8217;m writing about this so dramatically. If you are, you&amp;#8217;re probably not taking these exams any time soon. Because if you were&amp;#8230; YOU&amp;#8217;D BE FREAKING OUT TOO!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I hate most is when I’m panicking and someone tells me to ‘calm down’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2312 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;272&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Or, even worst, when they tell me &amp;#8220;there&amp;#8217;s nothing to worry about&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  With all due respect, I am perfectly able to decide what is and what is not worth worrying about. As is every other grad student.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And if you&amp;#8217;re about to do some exam that&amp;#8217;s going to decide whether you do or don&amp;#8217;t get to stay in grad school, then you, my friend, have a perfectly valid reason to freak out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So, to all my fellow grad students about to go through this ordeal:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  YOU&amp;#8217;RE FREAKING OUT!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;M FREAKING OUT!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  BUT WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER!!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  You&amp;#8217;ll have moments when you feel totally fine and in control of the situation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  You&amp;#8217;ll have moments when you don&amp;#8217;t feel okay at all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  These moments will come and go, but they are not an accurate reflection of how prepared you are, or your ability to be a good student.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Accept whatever way you feel right now, whether it is good or bad. It will pass.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The most important thing is that you keep going and keep doing whatever is best for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2313 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/giphy1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy1&#34; width=&#34;287&#34; height=&#34;311&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  With that pep talk out of the way, I will share with you what I think are the 5 essential steps to successfully completing your comprehensive exams.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Note that I say 5 steps, not 5 tips/pointers/points. The order is important and intentional here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I realize that not everything will be relevant to all grad students everywhere, but hopefully, there will be something useful in here for anyone who is in grad school or is considering this in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;1. Figure out the basics: when, where, what are your exams?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The most important thing you need to do is figure out exactly what it is you&amp;#8217;re actually doing. Don&amp;#8217;t assume anything here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Do you have a graduate handbook? Check it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;When&lt;/em&gt; is your exam?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Does it tell you a specific date for your exams?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Does it tell you what semester you are expected to have completed it?
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Where&lt;/em&gt; is your exam?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Where will it be held?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    How big is the room?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    How many people are taking it at once?
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Do you have to organize the time/date/venue yourself?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Is there a Head of Graduate studies (or equivalent) that is in charge of this?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And last, but not least:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; is your exam?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Is it a written exam, or is it oral?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Is it typed or handwritten?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Do you know the questions in advance?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Is it a take-home?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    What is the format/how many questions must you answer?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    How is it graded?
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  These are basic questions that are very important and should be sorted out as early as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Your graduate handbook may be a little vague, so speak to staff and previous cohorts to figure out how it&amp;#8217;s been done before.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;2. Look at past exams (questions/answers) &amp; talk to previous cohorts&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Past exams are the best resource for preparing yourself. Normally, these will be available through the department, so get access to them whenever you can.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Looking at past exam questions (over a period of 5-10 years) will give you an idea of the kinds of questions that keep coming up over and over again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  It will also give you an idea of how questions are asked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  What concepts are linked/contrasted?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  What level of detailed knowledge do you need to answer a question?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Ideally, you would also have access to past answers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The department may not make past answers available to students, but it is possible that previous cohorts still have their exam answers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  If you&amp;#8217;re super lucky like me, you&amp;#8217;ll be in a department where students decided to start collecting past exam answers to pass them on to future generations! (Consider starting this tradition if it doesn&amp;#8217;t exist at your university.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Past exam answers (especially when you know the grade received) are super useful because they give you a great idea of what you need to aim for to pass your exam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  If you have past exams available to you, READ THEM! And the more of them you read, the better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Reading a lot of past exams will show you what good answers have in common, as well as the ways in which you can be different and still successful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Once you read a number of these, you&amp;#8217;ll also get a feel for what does and does not work. This allows you to get a glimpse of the perspective the faculty will have (who are grading this).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And talk to previous cohorts! They have a wealth of knowledge about how your specific graduate program works and their advice will likely be a little more relevant than the advice of faculty who have taken their comprehensives 10+ years ago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So, I&amp;#8217;d like to take this moment to thank all the students in the years above me who have helped me:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2315 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/giphy2.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy2&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;3. Assess how much time you have to prepare and plan accordingly&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Before you dive into studying, you need to take stock of how much time you have to prepare. Since you already know when you&amp;#8217;re taking the exams thanks to Step 1, this shouldn&amp;#8217;t be too hard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This is important because if you are starting to study 1 year before your exams, you&amp;#8217;ll have a different you&amp;#8217;ll have a different approach to preparing than if you&amp;#8217;re starting 2 months in advance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Based off of my experience, people are usually busy with coursework and other things before they take their comprehensives, so you likely won&amp;#8217;t start (seriously) studying for these until the semester before, or the start of the semester in which you&amp;#8217;re taking the exams.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Considering this kind of timeline, I like to think in weeks. In other words, how many weeks until you have to take your exams?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Thinking in weeks will allow you to divide up your remaining time into the as many chunks as you have topics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  For example, this is what my preparation schedule looked like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2317 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/schedule.png&#34; alt=&#34;schedule&#34; width=&#34;1661&#34; height=&#34;840&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Make sure that the time spent on each topic is proportional to its representation in your exams (based on past years).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Some people like to start with the most difficult thing, others like to start with the easiest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Personally, I go somewhere in between. My reasoning is that, if you start with the most difficult thing, you&amp;#8217;ll get discouraged because you&amp;#8217;re not making progress quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Conversely, if you leave the most difficult things last, you&amp;#8217;ll be too stressed to work on something you already find difficult.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So, I like to do things in the order:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Neither hard nor easy.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Really hard.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Easy.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  That way, you can use the momentum of the first few tasks to motivate you for the difficult stuff and by the end, you have something pretty simple to work on before your big day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Have I overthought this? Yes, I absolutely have.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And a final note on planning: stay on track, but be flexible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m not just doing this to be annoying, I swear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  What I mean is that you shouldn&amp;#8217;t consistently work on a topic for longer than you planned to; you can&amp;#8217;t sacrifice one topic for the sake of another. It really is better to know a little about everything that will be on your exams, than to be an expert on 1 topic and know nothing about the rest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Once you&amp;#8217;ve understood the basics of a topic and you&amp;#8217;ve run out of time, move on, and come back to it if you have time later.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  That said, if you have to switch stuff around, that&amp;#8217;s no problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  In terms of the pitfalls of overscheduling for your candidacies, &lt;a href=&#34;http://humanhairdiversity.com/2017/09/06/remember-me/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;point 2 of my first blog post&lt;/a&gt; full of wisdom may be useful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;4. Understand diminishing returns: doing the most will hurt you&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Within each topic that you study, you have to prioritize the information that requires the least effort to gather and provides you with the highest payoff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Remember, you are not writing a thesis in each of these topics, you just need to write enough to show that you know what you are talking about.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Based on the past exams, you should have a good idea of the breadth and depth that is expected of you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Usually, you need to know the &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;most important concepts, authors, and examples&lt;/span&gt; for each of the topics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  You then need to be able to discuss how these are related to each other and how they are relevant to whatever question was asked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    You do NOT need to be able to regurgitate the title and date of every single article that was ever written by some important person.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    You do NOT need to know the details of every method that was discussed in the relevant papers.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  One of the biggest mistakes students make is getting caught up in the details. This is either by going into too much breadth or into too much depth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2316 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/returns.png&#34; alt=&#34;returns&#34; width=&#34;1149&#34; height=&#34;652&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This is a prime example of a case in which doing the most will hurt you!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  You have a finite amount of time to study for this and any time spent studying one topic is time taken away from studying another topic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  It&amp;#8217;s a comprehensive exam, which suggests you should learn ALL THE THINGS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2321 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/learnallthethings.png&#34; alt=&#34;learnallthethings&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;355&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2322 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/35didt-e1515798668256.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;35didt&#34; width=&#34;457&#34; height=&#34;460&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But you CANNOT learn ALL the things. So, don&amp;#8217;t try.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Do what you can, and that will be enough!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;5. Learn how to write exam essays&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: if you don’t need to write essays, you may want to skip to the last section)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Cambridge, which is a weird place for many reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  It&amp;#8217;s really old.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  People there wear gowns at an unnecessarily high frequency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  It has many weird traditions (like a graduation ceremony completely in Latin&amp;#8230;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But the weirdest, in my opinion, was the fact that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you only had exams once a year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  These exams consisted of a few days of spending 3 hours in some giant old hall writing essays about everything you had learnt that year, citations included, no notes allowed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  It also didn&amp;#8217;t help that the professors who proctored those exams wore long gowns that made them look just like dementors&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl id=&#34;attachment_2320&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width:500px;&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd class=&#34;wp-caption-dd&#34;&gt;
    Rare footage of Cambridge professors preparing to proctor an exam
  &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But back to the essay exams.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Your entire grade for the year (and your degree, during the final year) depended on whether you did well on those few days where you had to sit down for 3 hours and write 3 essays answering 3 questions that could be on any topic you had learnt for a class that year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I thought it was the most ridiculous thing ever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  When are you ever going to be locked up in a room for 3 hours and have to write a coherent commentary (with citations) with no notes????
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And then I came to grad school&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So, luckily, this was the one thing I felt kind of prepared for when I had to take my comprehensive exams last year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The most important thing I learnt during my time at Cambridge is that preparing for such exams requires &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;learning and practicing how to write exam essays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  You may have written essays before, but an exam essay is a whole other beast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  With that in mind, I have some tips specifically for writing exam essays.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Read the question, re-read the question, then read it again.
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This is pretty straightforward, but frequently overlooked. I&amp;#8217;ve known people who&amp;#8217;ve gotten poor marks for writing a great essay that answered a question they wished they&amp;#8217;d gotten, rather than the question they were supposed to answer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Always make sure you are answering the question that was asked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Write an outline
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Never just start writing, you need an outline. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Concept maps&lt;/a&gt; may be a good start.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2326&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2326&#34; style=&#34;width: 1136px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2326 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/basic-mind-map-structure.png&#34; alt=&#34;basic-mind-map-structure&#34; width=&#34;1136&#34; height=&#34;766&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2326&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mindmeister.com/blog/mind-maps-essay-writing/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; has some good tips on how to use these &amp;#8216;mind maps&amp;#8217; for essay writing.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  When you write your outline:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Read the question carefully.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Extract the main points from the question.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Brainstorm everything that is relevant to those points and vomit it out on a piece of paper.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Collect your word vomit and organize it into groups of related ideas.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Organize those ideas into paragraphs.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Frame those paragraphs by adding an introduction and a conclusion that answers the question.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So your final outline will look something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Introduction &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        A direct answer to the question.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        An explanation of how you will answer the question in this essay.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Your first main point
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Your second main point
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Your third main point
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    (Potentially a 4th main point, but you likely won&amp;#8217;t have time for this)
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Conclusion &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Recap how you have answered the question with your points.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  In brief, follow the classic essay-writing advice:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Say what you are going to say, say it, then say what you have said.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  When you are writing this outline, realize that you will not be able to write everything &lt;em&gt;ever written&lt;/em&gt; about the topic. You probably won&amp;#8217;t even be able to write everything &lt;em&gt;you know&lt;/em&gt; about the topic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  These essays are not a test of who can write the most, so don&amp;#8217;t try to do that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Prioritize the most important information. &lt;/strong&gt;How do you know what&amp;#8217;s important? Think about what your professors have been emphasizing when talking about this &amp;#8211; writing about this will show you&amp;#8217;ve paid attention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Also, consider your answer to the question. What pieces of evidence are most relevant to the answer you are giving?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  You have to strike a balance between showing you have a good amount of knowledge and show that you can answer a question concisely. It&amp;#8217;s not easy, but there are some tricks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  One thing I like to do is make my point and then add a little &amp;#8220;of course, there are other considerations, but these are beyond the scope of this essay.&amp;#8221; This shows that you know these other things exist, but you are consciously choosing not to discuss them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Remember that what you want to avoid here is a listing effect, i.e. &amp;#8220;A said X, B said Y, C said Z etc.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Synthesize, don&amp;#8217;t list.&lt;/strong&gt; This means you have to show you have thought about the question and can do more than regurgitate &amp;#8220;facts&amp;#8221; about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The best way to do this is to &amp;#8216;pick a side&amp;#8217;. Usually, the prompts to an essay question will give you the opportunity to argue one thing or another.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  You do not have to necessarily believe 100% in the side you are picking, but it will make writing the essay a whole lot easier if you don&amp;#8217;t try to argue both sides, because that&amp;#8217;s like trying to sing both parts to &amp;#8220;The Boy Is Mine&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; it comes across as muddled and rushed, and you do not sound good at all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl id=&#34;attachment_2324&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; style=&#34;width:320px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;dt class=&#34;wp-caption-dt&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2324 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/giphy4.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy4&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;220&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd class=&#34;wp-caption-dd&#34;&gt;
    Who can resist singing both parts to this song? It&amp;#8217;s a universal struggle
  &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  TIMING IS EVERYTHING
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  If you have a timed exam, you need to make sure you know how to write under time pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  If you know when you&amp;#8217;re exam is going to be, you should also know how long your exam will take.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So, for example, my undergraduate exams were 3 hours long and I had to answer three questions, so I had about 1 hour per essay.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  For my comprehensives in grad school, the exams were 6 hours each for 3 questions, so that was 2 hours per essay.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  That does not mean I had 2 hours to write because I had to factor in time for writing the outline beforehand and time to re-read what I wrote afterwards.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  For a two hour essay, this looks like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    10-15 mins brainstorming an outline
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    90 mins actually writing
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    10-15 mins re-reading and correcting
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Now, this may be controversial, but I would advise that you &lt;strong&gt;write ALL of your outlines at the beginning and do all of your re-reading at the end&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  For me, that meant spending 30 mins at the beginning of my 6-hour exam &amp;#8220;just&amp;#8221; brainstorming and outlining what I was going to write later on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  It may seem like a lot of time to sacrifice, and you may want to start writing immediately, but trust me, it&amp;#8217;s worth it!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  When you enter the last 1-2 hours of your exam and you&amp;#8217;re stressed out staring at a blank page in front of you, you may not write the most coherent essay. And writing something coherent is much more important than writing a lot!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  If you spend this time making a detailed outline, you can just switch your brain off afterwards and write nonstop. (Switching your brain off a little too much, is also why it may be worthwhile to spend some time re-reading at the end, though&amp;#8230;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Practice writing under time pressure&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  These things are like a marathon. You can&amp;#8217;t expect to do it without any practice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Getting an idea of what you are capable of writing under similar circumstances will make you feel more prepared for the day of the exam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  In the last few weeks before your exam, schedule in a couple of sessions where you practice writing under time pressure. If your exam is 6 hours long, that may be a bit much, but doing a 2-hour stint to write 1 essay would be a good idea at least once or twice. Then practice writing outlines in under 10 minutes, and you&amp;#8217;ll be golden.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  PEEL: recipe for easy paragraphs
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  As you&amp;#8217;re writing each paragraph, you don&amp;#8217;t want to be thinking about how to have the best possible flow. To avoid this, I use a little &amp;#8216;recipe&amp;#8217; for writing paragraphs that will clearly communicate to those grading the exam what I am trying to argue:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Point&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the point you want to make in this paragraph. &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        A brief sentence (or two) stating the main argument/point of this paragraph.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Explanation&lt;/strong&gt;: Why are you talking about this, what is the relevance? &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Elaborate what you mean by your previous statement.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: What is an example of this? &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Throw in a couple examples of the point your making. This is where you show off that you know the main authors and dates of important publications.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Link&lt;/strong&gt;: How does this relate to the question you are answering. &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Always make sure you synthesize and answer the question, so explain how this point is related to your main argument (and perhaps other paragraphs).
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Standard phrases (introductions, transitions, conclusions)
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2331 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cvq6vvs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cvq6vvs&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  You have no time to waste on &amp;#8216;phrasing&amp;#8217;, so prepare some standard introductions, transitions, and conclusions beforehand.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Introductions: &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &amp;#8216;In this essay, I will explain how X and Y appear to be related but are actually completely separate and independent phenomena&amp;#8217;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Transitions: &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &amp;#8220;Alternatively, however, nevertheless, albeit&amp;#8221;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Conclusions &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &amp;#8220;To sum up, all in all, in conclusion&amp;#8221;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2332&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2332&#34; style=&#34;width: 1113px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2332 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/transitional-phrases.png&#34; alt=&#34;transitional phrases&#34; width=&#34;1113&#34; height=&#34;800&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2332&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Just google around for &amp;#8220;transition words/phrases&amp;#8221; and you&amp;#8217;ll come across lists like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smart-words.org/linking-words/transition-words.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Going the extra mile: originality
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I remember reading the grading rubrics when I was in undergrad and thinking that they were hella vague. Especially looking at what distinguished a &amp;#8216;passing&amp;#8217; grade from an &amp;#8216;excellent&amp;#8217; grade was confusing to me because they would always talk about &amp;#8216;originality&amp;#8217;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  What is originality in an exam essay, even???
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  After a few years of jumping the hoop of exam essays, I think I sort of understand what they&amp;#8217;re looking for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  What you need is just a little flair. JUST A LITTLE.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Remember that this is the cherry on top, and it cannot come at the expense of the other requirements, such as &amp;#8216;having a good grasp of the topic&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;adequate breadth and depth&amp;#8217; etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  In my opinion, the best (and safest) way to show a bit of originality is throwing in a few &amp;#8216;unexpected&amp;#8217; citations. This shows you&amp;#8217;ve gone beyond the required reading and are able to see how &amp;#8216;new&amp;#8217; material relates to what you&amp;#8217;ve already been taught.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  These may be very new articles or very old ones. These could also be references drawn from another subject/discipline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  You can also impress those grading your exam by going against the grain and arguing something that is unorthodox for this particular subject (but make sure you&amp;#8217;re able to support your points with good evidence).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  My standard approach to adding in the flare is throwing in a little somethin&amp;#8217; somethin&amp;#8217; in the 3rd or 4th paragraph:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;While it is widely accepted that X is related to Y by Z, new evidence from the field of Industrial Unicorn Fabrication Theory suggests that we should consider&amp;#8230;.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This is a great opportunity to use your specific knowledge about something that may be relatively niche and give the faculty a chance to read something interesting that may set you apart from the dozens of other essays they&amp;#8217;ve read answering the exact same question.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But, honestly, as far as originality goes, make sure you don&amp;#8217;t go overboard because it can be a huge timesuck that makes your essay super confusing if you go off on a weird tangent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  (In undergrad, I had the brilliant idea of trying to do some kind of innovative analysis involving obscure French philosophers during a timed essay exam. Don&amp;#8217;t do that. Trust me, it&amp;#8217;s a mistake.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2333&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2333&#34; style=&#34;width: 429px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2333 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/giphy6.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy6&#34; width=&#34;429&#34; height=&#34;350&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2333&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Originality is the glitter of the exam essay world. Use it responsibly.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  A note on mental health and wellbeing
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  While preparing for the essay writing is important, your mental (and physical) health during this stressful time should not be overlooked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  When I was preparing for my comprehensives last year, I got into a great routine. I was doing pretty well. I was eating regularly, even exercising a bit. I was making good progress on my revision for the exams and I even managed to do a few timed essay sessions. On top of all of that, I had done this kind of exam before, so I had every reason to be calm and relaxed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But the night before my first exam, I could not fall asleep. And knowing how important it is to get a good night&amp;#8217;s sleep before big events, this frustrated me even more. My heart rate was so high and it felt like my heart was beating out of my chest. No amount of melatonin or other &amp;#8216;calming&amp;#8217; supplements would help. I kept trying to sleep but it wasn&amp;#8217;t until 5 or 6 in the morning that I managed to finally drift off and my exam was at 9am.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I was so nauseous in the morning, I couldn&amp;#8217;t stand to eat anything.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  When I got to my office, I tried to have more coffee because I thought it could compensate for my lack of sleep. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My hands were shaking so hard that I dropped my mug and broke it before I could even fill it with coffee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I somehow managed to get through the exam (even though one of my essays was horrible, in my opinion).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Two days later, I had to take the second part of the written exam and I still couldn&amp;#8217;t relax or sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  After the second part of the written exam, my heart was still beating like crazy and it seemed like there was nothing I could do to calm myself down.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I was so angry at myself. Why was my body doing this? Was I having some kind of reaction to something? What was wrong?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  There was nothing I could do to beat my body into submission. I even tried running myself into exhaustion in the hopes that I could sleep better, but even that didn&amp;#8217;t help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  After the second exam, I ended up going to the doctor who explained to me that I was having panic attacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I refused to believe it. I had no rational reason to have a panic attack. I was convinced that it had to be something else that was stopping me from sleeping and making my heart go crazy. But, unfortunately for me, she explained that panic attacks were not something you could rationalize away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Luckily, with her help, I managed to get things under control somewhat by the time I had the oral part of my examination the week after. And luckily, I did pretty okay on my exams, despite all of this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But, in hindsight, I did not do a great job of taking care of myself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I had a good idea of what I had to do, but I thought if I just pushed harder and harder, I could force myself to do better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I was taking enough melatonin to put a horse to sleep (and more is not better, in this case), and in the mornings I was taking enough caffeine to bring the dead back to life. And this is not taking into account the 20 other supplements I ordered from Amazon in the hopes of improving my memory and sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So why am I (over)sharing this with you?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I just want to emphasize that exam preparation involves self care as well. This may mean different things for different people, but it&amp;#8217;s important for everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Spend time with the people you love.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Get some fresh air.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Speak with a therapist (honestly, not a bad investment for grad school).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Be consistent with your medications, if you are taking any.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Watch something that makes you laugh.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Cuddle with something fluffy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Reach out and ask for help when you need it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  To everyone preparing for these exams, I wish you the best of luck. You are awesome and you&amp;#8217;re a superhero.  This won&amp;#8217;t be the most fun part of this PhD, but remember that you started this because you love what you do and you have an insatiable sense of curiosity and wonder. There will be great times ahead once you finish these exams, I promise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#999999;&#34;&gt;Estimated reading time: 7 mins (1289 words)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I was at a conference in Kobe, Japan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And it was AWESOME!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Funny thing is I only found out I was going to this conference about two weeks before it started.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  How did that happen? Well, I&amp;#8217;m glad you asked&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So, at the moment, I&amp;#8217;m in the process of putting together my &lt;em&gt;doctoral committee&lt;/em&gt;. Basically, I&amp;#8217;m asking a bunch of professors if they would kindly agree to evaluate my work and be the judges at my defense when I finish up this Ph.D.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2282&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2282&#34; style=&#34;width: 480px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2282&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/giphy4.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy4&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;353&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2282&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;100% real genuine footage of a doctoral committee judging a Ph.D. student on the verge of tears.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, I met a professor who was potentially going to be on my committee (he has since agreed, yay!). This professor, Larry Kenney, is a professor in Kinesiology &amp;amp; Physiology. (This may not immediately seem like a logical choice of committee member for an anthropologist studying hair, but Dr. Kenney knows a lot about thermoregulation which is handy if you want to figure out whether human hair morphology affects our ability to stay cool in the sun.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Towards the end of October, Dr. Kenney introduced me to a collaborator of his who would be able to help me with designing the experiments for my research, Dr. George Havenith.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Since Dr. George Havenith was based at Loughborough University in the UK, our first conversation was over Skype.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Our virtual meeting went very well! We talked about some ideas for experiments and simulations, I even had the chance to flex my Dutch language skills as both Dr. Havenith and I are from the Netherlands.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;This is where things got interesting.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Dr. Havenith and Dr. Kenney mentioned they were going to a conference in Japan in three weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Then they suggested that I should come along.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2283&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2283&#34; style=&#34;width: 245px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2283&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/giphy5.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy5&#34; width=&#34;245&#34; height=&#34;245&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2283&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;I was, as the kids say, SHOOK.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  At first, I thought they were joking, but they insisted that this would be a great opportunity for me to present my ideas to a crowd of experts who could give me feedback and ideas on how to test my hypotheses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Needless to say, I did not need a lot of convincing. When someone asks you &amp;#8220;Do you want to go to Japan?&amp;#8221; you say &amp;#8220;How long do I have to pack my bags?&amp;#8221; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But realistically, this conference was in 3 weeks and I did not have the kind of spare cash lying around to go on a trip like this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I didn&amp;#8217;t think this was going to happen, but Dr. Kenney and Dr. Havenith encouraged me to ask my advisor about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  In the Netherlands, we have this great saying:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8216;Nee&amp;#8217; heb je al, &amp;#8216;ja&amp;#8217; kun je krijgen.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which translates to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;You already have &amp;#8216;no&amp;#8217;, but you could get a &amp;#8216;yes&amp;#8217;. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Basically, this is the Dutch version of &amp;#8220;it never hurts to ask&amp;#8221;. And boy was this true. I asked my advisor (Dr. Nina Jablonski) and she immediately said: &amp;#8220;Yes, this is a great idea, let&amp;#8217;s get it sorted out ASAP.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2285&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2285&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2285&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/giphy7.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy7&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;390&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2285&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;She said &amp;#8216;yes&amp;#8217;???&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Then, in about one week I had to throw together an abstract + a poster to send to the conference organizers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I thought I was real slick for getting myself into this conference, but when I was writing the 5th version of the abstract and the 245th draft of the poster I definitely was slightly less enthused about the whole thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2286&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2286&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone wp-image-2286&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/giphy8.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy8&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2286&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;10/10 would **_not_** recommend making a poster in a week because this is what you will feel like.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But luckily it all worked out in the end and I had my poster and I was going to JAPAN!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2289&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2289&#34; style=&#34;width: 750px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2289&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/poster-done.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Poster done&#34; width=&#34;750&#34; height=&#34;1002&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2289&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Talia was just as happy as I was that this poster was finally done because she&amp;#8217;s supportive like that &lt;3&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And yes, you read that correctly this was the first poster presentation of my academic career!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;ve noticed that in the U.S. presenting posters and going to conferences is strongly encouraged for graduate students (and even undergraduates!). But since I did my undergrad in the U.K., this wasn&amp;#8217;t an opportunity I&amp;#8217;d had before. And since the first two years of grad school were so full of coursework for me here, I didn&amp;#8217;t have the time to present before.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I find it kind of funny that my first poster presentation ever is not even at an anthropology conference, but some things just work out that way, I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The conference I went to is the International Conference on Environmental Ergonomics (ICEE for short). This is a conference that happens every other year and it&amp;#8217;s incredibly interdisciplinary with researchers who do mathematical modeling, to experimental physiologists and everything in between.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And it&amp;#8217;s a very small conference!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  In total, I think there were only about 200 people attending, and there was only one session at a time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This is a huge contrast to the annual meeting for the American Association of Physical Anthropologists where you have thousands of people and 20 things going on at once.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Having been to both a big and a small conference now, I can say with confidence that there are some clear benefits to going to a smaller conference!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  For the first time in my conferencing life (which consists of a grand total of 3 conferences), I was able to actually have meaningful conversations with multiple senior and junior academics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Usually, at a big conference, it&amp;#8217;s just so overwhelmingly crowded that it&amp;#8217;s intimidating to talk to people you don&amp;#8217;t know (especially as a graduate student).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But by the end of this conference, I pretty much knew all the students, professors and other researchers who were there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This was in no small way facilitated by the fact that Dr. Kenney introduced me to everyone he knew there. Apparently, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v545/n7654/full/nj7654-377a.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;this is his M.O. for mentoring students&lt;/a&gt;. What can I say? I have been very lucky with the advisors that have come into my life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2288&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2288&#34; style=&#34;width: 717px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2288&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/image-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;image (1)&#34; width=&#34;717&#34; height=&#34;770&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2288&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Yours truly at her poster.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Thanks to Dr. Kenney and Dr. Havenith (and Dr. Jablonski!) my poster session went really well and I managed to get a lot of excellent feedback on my ideas. All of the conversations I had with people that day will definitely help me in putting together the best plan of action for tackling my research questions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Another awesome thing about this conference is that I got to meet with a lot of amazing students who are doing really exciting research.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2290&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2290&#34; style=&#34;width: 1334px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2290&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/okonomiyaki.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Okonomiyaki&#34; width=&#34;1334&#34; height=&#34;750&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2290&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Meeting fellow students over beer and okonomiyaki is definitely a plus for this conference!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A really important piece of advice that I’ve heard is: &lt;strong&gt;don’t just ‘network’ with professors, talk to other students.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t agree with this more. When you go to a conference, it’s a great opportunity to meet famous professors, yes, but the students you are seeing there are your future colleagues and collaborators, so don’t miss out on the opportunity to meet them too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel so incredibly lucky to have had my advisor’s support in going to this conference. Not only was it a great learning experience allowing me to meet Dr. Havenith in real life, but it was also in JAPAN!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my first time in Japan and, given that I have wanted to go there since I was about 14 years old, this was kind of a dream come true for me and I had to try really hard not to spend the whole week running around screaming “OMG I CAN’T BELIEVE I’M IN JAPAN ASDFJKLF!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you, I took in as much of Kobe as I possibly could during that week and it was fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2293&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2293&#34; style=&#34;width: 3024px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2293&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/bubble-tea.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Bubble tea&#34; width=&#34;3024&#34; height=&#34;3024&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2293&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;They had ready-made bubble tea in their convenience stores &amp;#8211; I was in heaven&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2294&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2294&#34; style=&#34;width: 1334px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2294&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/24259400_10155879280472748_867596541_o.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;24259400_10155879280472748_867596541_o.jpg&#34; width=&#34;1334&#34; height=&#34;750&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2294&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;The city was beautiful.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only glitch in the whole thing was that I struggled with some of the customs a bit more than expected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-width=&#34;550&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
    I didn’t realize it would be so hard to do this polite Japanese bow thing properly 😭
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Do you hinge from the hips like a deadlift?? And where should my eyes be looking???
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    I should’ve googled this before landing *panic*
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But luckily no one seemed to mind, although my attempts to bow clearly made them laugh!&lt;/p&gt;

  What better way to introduce a blog than by telling you all the ways in which I messed up?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Kind of joking, kind of not.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I seriously have been wondering about the best way to introduce this blog (but that&amp;#8217;s not all I&amp;#8217;ve been doing for three years, don&amp;#8217;t worry, there&amp;#8217;s plenty more I worried about).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  However, it&amp;#8217;s been 3 years, and it is comical at this point so I would like to share a distillation of the most important life lessons I have learnt while procrastinating this blog for few years:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;1 . My to-do list is infinitely long, it&amp;#8217;s growing exponentially, and tasks are not exactly getting crossed off.&lt;/strong&gt; I remember when Facebook introduced the &amp;#8220;save&amp;#8221; button function. I. LOVED. IT. I remember thinking &amp;#8220;Wow, this is so useful! Now my workflow won&amp;#8217;t get interrupted by super interesting articles because I can just save them for later! Brilliant!&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Cue reality&amp;#8230;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-599&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/saved-fb-posts.png&#34; alt=&#34;saved fb posts&#34; width=&#34;812&#34; height=&#34;156&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This is who I am as a person and I have to come to terms with it. It&amp;#8217;s honestly all done with the *intention* of actually reading/watching it, but I just never find the time!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  My expectation was that I would somehow magically stop going through Facebook&amp;#8217;s endless scroll (yeah, sure&amp;#8230;) and THEN on a regular basis check my saved posts, read them and tick them off in an organized manner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  What actually happened was that I just kept on scrolling (endless scroll will do that to you&amp;#8230;) and saving, scrolling, saving, scrolling, saving &amp;#8211; until I was jolted upright by some kind of reminder of an immediate deadline or the realization that 3 hours had passed and I&amp;#8217;d done literally nothing but Facebook my life away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Funny thing is, I started noticing this happened not just with Facebook, but with &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I *love* me a to-do list. Mmmmm, good stuff! Pen and paper, app-based, check boxes on Evernote/Word. Doesn&amp;#8217;t matter &amp;#8211; love &amp;#8217;em all! Once it&amp;#8217;s on your to-do list, it&amp;#8217;s basically already done and you can chill!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-611&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy&#34; width=&#34;444&#34; height=&#34;250&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  It makes me feel so organized. Like, look at it, there is a physical representation of all my good intentions! And we all know ah-MAY-zingly that works, right? (see all previous New Year&amp;#8217;s resolutions for reference)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was that my little to-do list habit was covering up a bigger issue underneath: I spent a lot more time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; about the stuff I was going to do than actually &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; the stuff I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And it didn&amp;#8217;t matter what area of my life I was focusing on, this was an issue everywhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Blog? Man, I have ideas for so many posts! I&amp;#8217;m gonna write about this, that and oooh, this would be really great, and what about&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Academic work? Can&amp;#8217;t start writing this yet, duh! Gotta think up MORE options! We could do A) B), or even better C). No, actually, what about Χ, Ψ, Ω. Or wait, you know what would be an absolutely fascinating approach????   (⑅∫°ਊ°)∫
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Dude, even MEAL PREP! &amp;#8220;What should I eat this week?&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-621&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/giphy1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy1&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;247&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But, in the end, no choices are made, there&amp;#8217;s no food and I&amp;#8217;m hangry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  You get it, it was an all-around issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But every time I became aware of what was going on for a split second, I had an excuse. I wasn&amp;#8217;t *really* procrastinating, I was just full of ideas!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_625&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-625&#34; style=&#34;width: 900px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-625&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/ideaman.png&#34; alt=&#34;ideaman&#34; width=&#34;900&#34; height=&#34;675&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-625&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;From the waitbutwhy.com post on procrastination&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But you can&amp;#8217;t *just* be an ideas person. You&amp;#8217;ve gotta actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  When you add to that perfectionism (&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.plos.org/thestudentblog/2016/05/17/academiaanxiety/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;which a lot of people struggle with in academia&lt;/a&gt;), nothing ever gets done, yet every moment is stressful as hell (double fun!).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Sometimes I tried to get around it by focusing on smaller tasks. But a lot of times, those smaller tasks just turned into me focusing on details at the expense of the big picture. (Bruv, do you know how much time I spent thinking and rethinking the title of my blog? The subtitle, the potential categories, color schemes, tags, pages etc??? Yeah&amp;#8230;.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  My mom used to tell me that in Bulgaria they had a small story about this type of attitude:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Ah, these buttons are perfect! Now, all I need is the coat for them to be sewn onto!&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Okay, look, it might&amp;#8217;ve been funnier in Bulgarian&amp;#8230; and when my mom told it. Or maybe it&amp;#8217;s not funny at all&amp;#8230;But you get the point!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I wish I could say that I eventually found an easy solution or system for getting through your to-do lists, but I haven&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  However, I&amp;#8217;ve gotten better at it by accepting that you&amp;#8217;ve gotta start somewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Just pick a thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Then &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Yeah, there are &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; things you could do, &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; ideas you might have, but you have to spend most of your time actually &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; the things you want to do instead of &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; about the things you want to do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  If it seems important, write it down for later. If it&amp;#8217;s not, finish what you are doing and stop double-guessing yourself; you can think about it later.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Doing what you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; is a lot more satisfying than dwelling on what you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And even when you &amp;#8220;understand&amp;#8221; this, it takes practice to apply it, but eventually, your habits improve and that&amp;#8217;s good enough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  (But on a side note, I&amp;#8217;m like 100% sure that if I had just a few more weeks this blog would be a million times better, but I&amp;#8217;m scared that my friends might actually handcuff me and press the publish button for me if I procrastinate any longer, but, other than that, I totally learnt my lesson, I swear&amp;#8230;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;2 . Everything takes SO MUCH LONGER to do than you think and NOTHING goes according to plan.&lt;/strong&gt; What&amp;#8217;s the reading time for this blog post? 13 minutes. What&amp;#8217;s the writing time for this blog post? Well, lemme tell you it&amp;#8217;s not 13 minutes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  To be honest, I&amp;#8217;m not sure exactly how long it took me to write this. But roughly, 3-4 hours, not counting &amp;#8220;thinking time&amp;#8221; beforehand, previous rough drafts, and editing time afterward. (And being that this point was written about halfway through the post, it means I actually had to go back to edit this estimate.) Does this mean I spent those hours typing non-stop? Nope. How many bathroom breaks, food breaks, tea breaks, staring-at-the-space-around-my-desk breaks does include???
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Who knows!?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But did that stop me from wanting to plan out exactly how this was going to go?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  You bet your pretty lil face it didn&amp;#8217;t!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-640&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/giphy2.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy2&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;323&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Along with a deep love of to-do lists (see point 1), I also have very strong feelings about timetables. Again, whether I write them out super neatly, type them up on Word or have a beautiful color-coded iCloud calendar or even a scheduling app, it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter &amp;#8211; I love all of it!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I mean, clearly, the solution to all of life&amp;#8217;s problems and the key to success is planning out every little thing as it *should* happen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Why would you &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; plan meticulously? It&amp;#8217;s fool-proof! If you just write down what&amp;#8217;s gonna happen; then that&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s gonna happen, BOOM!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;Fail to plan and you plan to fail&amp;#8221; is a cliché for a reason!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-646&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/tumblr_lpvlsg8xlf1qhr8fgo1_500.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tumblr_lpvlsg8xlf1qhr8fgo1_500&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;273&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  When I finished my first year as an undergraduate, I thought that by now I would have solved the question of human hair diversity and have moved onto a brief stint in the UN to finally achieve world peace before spending a few years mastering Kung Fu at a Shaolin monastery after which I would just travel the world and learn a couple language (you know, just in case I got bored).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  By the first year of graduate school, I had readjusted that plan to something I thought was more realistic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I thought that by the beginning of year 3 I would have learnt ALL OF THE GENETICS, a decent amount of Chemistry, and of course, my dissertation would be half written and I would have had this blog published ages ago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Lol, nope, not even that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Really long term plans are no use.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Hopes, aspirations, yes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But actual, concrete plans, not so much&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Even in the shorter term, you often have to readjust your course as you get new information.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  E.g. Really important realization on my part: I will never learn &amp;#8220;ALL THE GENETICS&amp;#8221; because even geneticists don&amp;#8217;t know all of the genetics. No one does. It&amp;#8217;s kind of unknowable. Very much a case of &amp;#8216;the more you know, the less you know&amp;#8217;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And a big problem is that a lot of these &amp;#8220;goals&amp;#8221; that I had were very broad and vague. (Laugh at me if you will, but honestly, at the time it seemed like a completely reasonable, doable plan).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  In the end, realistic goals for grad school were set with the help of my advisor and the graduate handbook that we have.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  What is a realistic goal?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Pass class X in the fall semester.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Take exam Y in the spring.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Write proposal Z by deadline A.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Those are some realistic goals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But I, being who I am, tried to plan those out more precisely too! Forget the syllabus, make your own!!! I can do all of the things and then more! Do all of these extra things and make a daily plan!!! (Again, sounded much better in my head at the time)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_660&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-660&#34; style=&#34;width: 730px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-660&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/do-all-the-things1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;do-all-the-things1&#34; width=&#34;730&#34; height=&#34;548&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-660&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;This meme from hyporboleandahalf.com is always relevant in my life.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Does that mean your only choice is to abandon any attempt to plan or schedule?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  No,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-665&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1396.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img_1396&#34; width=&#34;1200&#34; height=&#34;636&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  With time, I have understood that the necessity to plan things falls on a spectrum from &lt;span style=&#34;color:#339966;&#34;&gt;things that have a LOW need for planning and you can be very flexible about&lt;/span&gt; to&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff0000;&#34;&gt; things that have a HIGH need for planning and you must be strict about&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And it&amp;#8217;s not just a single universal scale. It&amp;#8217;s a scale that each person must construct for themselves (depending on their priorities) and it can be constructed for many different types of situations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  For example&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Exam prep:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#339966;&#34;&gt;Low&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8211; break times while studying, shows to watch as a distraction, beverages to drink while relaxing studying&amp;#8230;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff9900;&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8211; How much time to spend on various exam topics. Study material.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff0000;&#34;&gt;High&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8211; WHERE IS THE EXAM?! WHAT TIME? HOW DO I GET THERE?!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  (capitalization and punctuation are to emphasize level of freaking out which is appropriate if you fail to plan these things)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But equally, one can imagine that such a template can be applied to something like planning a holiday&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#339966;&#34;&gt;Low&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8211; what routes to walk through the city, what sights to see, what time to wake up&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff9900;&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8211; A few food stands/restaurants you definitely don&amp;#8217;t want to miss. Location and times for museums or shows you want to see.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff6600;&#34;&gt;Medium-High&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8211; How to hit up every Krispy Kreme on the way to the final destination?! Are we sure Hot Krispy notifications are ready to alert on phone at all times!?!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff0000;&#34;&gt;High&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8211; WHAT TIME IS FLIGHT?! WHAT GATE AND AIRPORT IS IT AT?!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Like I said, these scales are highly personal and context specific&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;3 . Knowing when to turn to others for help is more important than you might imagine.&lt;/strong&gt; No one succeeds on their own. This is why awards have acceptance speeches featuring thank yous; this is why books and papers have acknowledgment sections.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Of course, you can and should work hard. But not everything you have and achieve can be purely through your own efforts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  There&amp;#8217;s parents and caregivers who raise you (a category that features prominently in acknowledgments!). Teachers and professors who help you learn skills and guide you to the knowledge that you need to achieve your goals. Friends who help you deal with life and hold you accountable when that&amp;#8217;s what you need.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And countless other acquaintances and strangers that hold visible and invisible roles in your life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Humans, as a species, are pretty hopeless as individuals. Without going on an Anthropology 101 tangent, there&amp;#8217;s a reason why studying the history of humans makes you so humble to the importance of cooperation. Without humans doing different tasks and coordinating with each other, there would be a pretty big limit on the things you could do on your own. All I know is that if I had to worry about &lt;em&gt;literal survival&lt;/em&gt; every day, finding food and shelter&amp;#8230;. well, I&amp;#8217;d have even less time to write my doctoral thesis&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But I&amp;#8217;m not writing all these cheesy, emotional, mushy things just to emphasize the importance of gratitude.
&lt;/p&gt;

  Gratitude is important, yes. But realizing that you are already getting help should make it easier to seek it out when you need it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  For whatever reason, asking for help can be very difficult.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s because you feel like you should be able to do it all on your own, otherwise, it&amp;#8217;s cheating or you don&amp;#8217;t deserve it. Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s because you&amp;#8217;re afraid you&amp;#8217;ll be a burden.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And the struggle to ask for help is kind of how writing this blog and going to grad school came about for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Towards the end of 2014, due to some unforeseen circumstances, I did not have the funds that I needed to complete my applications to grad school. I was short on time and there was no way I could get another job/pay check, credit card or loan before the deadlines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So I decided to start a little crowdfund.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Reluctantly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Like, really reluctantly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  On the inside, I was sooooooooo not into the idea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-684&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/giphy3.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy3&#34; width=&#34;474&#34; height=&#34;314&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I was scared. Embarrassed. Terrified of what people might say&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;Why doesn&amp;#8217;t she just ask her parents?&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;Why didn&amp;#8217;t she think ahead?&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;She doesn&amp;#8217;t deserve it, she&amp;#8217;s irresponsible&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;Her work is not that interesting or important; why would I help her?&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;She should just find a job, earn money, and apply next year&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But I just shoved all those negative thoughts into a box and tried anyway because somewhere, deep inside, under 569 layers of insecurity, I kind of thought my project might be interesting enough for some people to help me do it (does that sound too confident?).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So, seeing this as my only shot, I went ahead and asked for help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And to my surprise, a lot of people responded positively! When I posted about it on Facebook and Tumblr, a lot of my friends donated. A lot of them shared. And then donations and messages even started coming in from people I had never met!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I couldn&amp;#8217;t believe that so many people believed me and, not only that, they believed &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; me and my ability to get into grad school and be successful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  With the help of all those people, not to mention the friends and mentors who helped me write and re-write my applications, professors who took the time to write letters of recommendation and advise me, and random people who posted resources for the GREs online; I got into grad school.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  It&amp;#8217;s still hard to turn to others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I want to work hard; I don&amp;#8217;t expect any hand-holding. There&amp;#8217;s still a little pride in that; there&amp;#8217;s still a little fear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But I try to be realistic about when I can&amp;#8217;t do something alone. And I know that if I ask for help, there will be people out there willing to be there for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I feel very lucky to have gotten where I am now, and there are a lot of people who I feel I can never repay for their help. So, whenever I can, I try to pay it forward.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  In some way, I&amp;#8217;m hoping this blog can be a way of paying it forward. If there are people out there who supported me because they want to know about the things I research, then this will be a chance to inform them. If there are people who want to know what it&amp;#8217;s like to be in grad school and how to deal with certain issues that go along with that, hopefully, I can write something of use to them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And if there is anyone who can tolerate my sense of humor, who knows, maybe I can make them laugh????
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

  Anyhow, this concludes my introductory post and you can look forward to the first hair science post next week. But to keep you entertained until then, you can have a look at what to expect from &lt;a href=&#34;http://humanhairdiversity.com/about-this-blog/&#34;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;, more details about &lt;a href=&#34;http://humanhairdiversity.com/about-the-study/&#34;&gt;my research&lt;/a&gt;, and the story of &lt;a href=&#34;http://humanhairdiversity.com/how-i-got-here/&#34;&gt;how I ended up doing a PhD on human hair diversity&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  P.S. I would really recommend the posts on procrastination on waitbutwhy.com &amp;#8211; they were probably the most helpful thing I found while I was procrastinating by googling &amp;#8220;how to stop procrastinating&amp;#8221; a few years ago. (Here&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;)
