&lt;p&gt;So, you may have heard that a paper was recently published on the genome of a girl who lived around 90,000 years ago and was half-Neanderthal and half-Denisovan.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It kinda made the news…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people were excited, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; just geneticists and researchers working with human fossils. And my favorite thing about a science story going viral is that it brings out the comedy gold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-width=&#34;550&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;

    I&#39;m picturing a 13 year old starting secondary school and telling her new friends: &#34;me mam&#39;s a neanderthal, dad&#39;s a denisovan, bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.&#34; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/I4fGRZEmO2&#34;&gt;https://t.co/I4fGRZEmO2&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;

    Do me like you&#39;re a neanderthal woman and I&#39;m a denisovan man.

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, even &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06004-0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Nature’s story on this publication&lt;/a&gt; was feeling cheeky:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-2408&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/nature_article.png&#34; alt=&#34;nature_article&#34; width=&#34;506&#34; height=&#34;757&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the ultimate tweets were without a doubt the Monty Python references:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-width=&#34;550&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;

    This is actually fascinating stuff, but I can&#39;t read &#34;Her mother was a Neanderthal, and her father was a Denisovan&#34; without hearing John Cleese&#39;s French taunter from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/AfthERMhSD&#34;&gt;https://t.co/AfthERMhSD&lt;/a&gt;

    The Neanderthal-Denisovan ancient mashup makes me think of this. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/iGTqFFCCWZ&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/iGTqFFCCWZ&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while the news articles that ran on this story gave a good overview of why researchers were excited about it, without the historical context of how we’ve understood human evolution until now, it can be really hard to understand just how incredible this discovery is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s back up a little bit…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to take you back all the way to when I was a wee baby undergrad…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2409&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2409&#34; style=&#34;width: 480px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-2409&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;270&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2409&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Are you ready for story time, kids?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011 – an entire 7 years ago – I was just starting my first year at university. Going to all these lectures and learning about archaeology, social anthropology, and biological anthropology was really exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the thing I loved most, was all the time we got to have with the professors in small group settings. To this day, I truly believe that this aspect of Cambridge education is why I feel so comfortable in academia, but that’s a story for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the professors I spent the most time with, was the Archaeology professor at my college, Sir Paul Mellars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2419&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2419&#34; style=&#34;width: 628px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-2419&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/mellars.png&#34; alt=&#34;mellars.PNG&#34; width=&#34;628&#34; height=&#34;942&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2419&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/sir-paul-mellars?alloweduse=availableforalluses&amp;family=creative&amp;license=rf&amp;phrase=sir%20paul%20mellars&amp;sort=best#license&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;This is a picture of him getting knighted by Prince Charles.&lt;/a&gt; I don&amp;#8217;t know why I find it so funny, but I can&amp;#8217;t help but laugh that I knew someone who went through such a fancy ritual.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember being terrified to meet him when I came to interview at Cambridge, but once I was actually in and after I’d had a few supervisions with him, that went away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2410&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2410&#34; style=&#34;width: 1164px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-2410&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/paul-mellars.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Paul Mellars&#34; width=&#34;1164&#34; height=&#34;873&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2410&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;I know y&amp;#8217;all be like &amp;#8220;pics or it didn&amp;#8217;t happen&amp;#8221;, so hereby, pics of me, Paul Mellars and the other lovely anthropology students at Corpus Christi College.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Mellars is probably one of the most entertaining people I’ve ever met. Mostly because, in my eyes, he’s this fancy unicorn who is everything you’d imagine a Cambridge &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_don&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;don&lt;/a&gt; to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Mellars has this low booming voice, and he would often be smoking his pipe or a cigar in his office. Part of me kind of imagines that this is what Santa looks like in his time off,  which is something I obviously never mentioned to his face (and since I don’t expect he’s online much, I don’t think he’ll ever find out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to get to the point, in our supervisions, he would always tell stories. It was one of my favorite things about him because, unlike other supervisors, he wouldn’t necessarily grill us with questions and I could rely on him doing most of the talking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I distinctly remember talking with him about was Neandertals and why they had gone “extinct”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Mellars wasn’t just any random archaeologist, after all. What he was known and knighted for was, in part, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16xwbv4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;his work on Neanderthals&lt;/a&gt;. He was an expert on stone tools of the Middle-Upper Paleolithic (~300,000-10,000 years ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By studying various stone tool &lt;em&gt;industries&lt;/em&gt; across Europe, archaeologists are able to say something about who might have been making them and when certain people came into contact with others or were perhaps replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2411&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2411&#34; style=&#34;width: 1280px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-2411&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/1280px-mousterian_points_and_scrapers_wellcome_m0015182.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;1280px-mousterian_points_and_scrapers_wellcome_m0015182&#34; width=&#34;1280&#34; height=&#34;920&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2411&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;What we can learn from stone tools is awesome, but god I hated all my stone tool lectures and reading because looking at variously carved rocks for hours is something I simply don&amp;#8217;t have the attention span for.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So based on the fossil evidence, the archaeological/stone tool evidence, and the genetic evidence (at the time), it appeared that Neanderthals had simply vanished at some point. Or in any case, at some point, the skeletal morphology and stone tools we associate with Neanderthals was gone, and that time seemed to coincide with what was interpreted as the arrival of “anatomically modern humans”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of debate, but very few people who studied human evolution believed that Neanderthals had contributed to the modern human gene pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2012, during my second year, I remember writing essays about why Neanderthals might have disappeared, and evaluating the evidence about them having gone extinct vs having interbred with us. I remember asking Professor Mellars what he thought, and he said it was unlikely Neanderthals interbred with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of what I read about the disappearance of Neanderthals was that “modern humans” must have &lt;em&gt;outcompeted&lt;/em&gt; Neanderthals with our superior cognitive skills or &lt;em&gt;replaced&lt;/em&gt; them after they disappeared due to their inability to adapt to the changing climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t put my finger on it at the time, but I felt weird about the language that was being used around Neanderthals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also felt really uncomfortable that all explanations about this apparent disappearance of Neanderthals seemed to be centered on a post-hoc explanation of why “we” were simply better than them. Despite being wrapped in the language of natural selection, it seemed oddly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00313220500106170&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;similar to 19th-century arguments naturalizing colonialism and the “inevitable demise” of certain peoples&lt;/a&gt;. And I am certainly not the first person to draw the link between natural selection, eugenics, and colonialism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over the last few years, a lot of things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;theories-on-how-humans-evolved-one-origin-or-multiple&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theories on how humans evolved: one origin or multiple?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before genetic evidence really came onto the scene, most of what we had to base our understanding of human evolution on was fossil evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this fossil evidence, during the late 20th century, two camps had formed: multiregionalists and those who thought modern humans were the product of a single-out-of-Africa expansion (clearly, the latter had a much less catchy group name, but I digress…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiregionalists saw continuity between the skeletal anatomy of archaic hominins (i.e. Neanderthals in Europe and &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; in Asia) and the respective modern populations in each continent. For example, some researchers emphasized the similarity between the “shovel-shaped” teeth found in &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt;, and the presence of similar dental morphology in modern East Asian populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, proponents of the single ‘Out of Africa’ hypothesis saw similarities between the skeletal morphology of late African &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; specimens and all modern humans. Some even went as far as to claim that all modern humans were the result of a ‘cognitive behavioral revolution’ around 70,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980’s, when researchers were finally able to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;sequence&lt;/a&gt; mtDNA (DNA that is inherited maternally), it appeared to support the idea that all humans today traced their ancestry back, exclusively, to a single group based in Africa around 200,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, most people abandoned the multiregional hypothesis of human origins, but also any idea that Neanderthals (or other hominins) might have contributed to the modern gene pool at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-new-kid-on-the-block-ancient-dna&#34;&gt;The new kid on the block: Ancient DNA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading about the history of science is fascinating because it shows the extent to which our knowledge is shaped by the technology we have, but also the questions we choose to ask and the tools we use to answer those questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re at all interested in understanding how weird and winding this path to our current understanding of Neanderthal/Denisovan/ancient human genetics was, I’d recommend you read Svante Pääbo’s autobiography ‘&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/books/review/neanderthal-man-by-svante-paabo.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Neanderthal Man&lt;/a&gt;‘ where he discusses how he developed the methods that allowed researchers to extract and sequence ancient DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to get back to our story, when we began analyzing ancient DNA, it was a pain and it was difficult. Getting even a small sequence was a huge victory. So when they got a bit of Neanderthal mtDNA sequenced in the late 1990’s, it was something worth celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When complete Neanderthal mtDNA sequences followed in 2008 and 2009, while exciting, the evidence still was in line with a single out of Africa expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, everything changed in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-2412&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/3880765.gif&#34; alt=&#34;3880765&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What many researchers in human evolution thought was true fundamentally changed when Svante Pääbo’s group published &lt;a href=&#34;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/710&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;the draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome&lt;/a&gt; and concluded that &lt;a href=&#34;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/680&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;there was evidence of Neanderthal introgression&lt;/a&gt; (genetic contribution) to modern day populations outside of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same year, their group also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08976&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;published the mitochondrial (mtDNA) sequence of an unknown hominin&lt;/a&gt;, that appeared to group neither with modern humans nor with Neanderthals – &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/464838a&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;we now refer to them as Denisovans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we were able to sequence the nuclear genomes of both Neanderthals and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09710&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Denisovans&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to get the full picture, rather than just the matrilineal side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there was an “ancient DNA rush” during this time, not everyone was convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, people were proposing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435202/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;alternative hypotheses based on ancient population structure &lt;/a&gt;that could explain the genetic similarity we see between non-Africans and Neanderthals. In other words, what we see could be explained by the fact that non-Africans came from an ancestral population that was genetically more similar to Neanderthals, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/doubts-about-whether-modern-humans-and-neanderthals-interbred&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;but they did not interbreed with them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we have commercially available genetic reports like 23andMe that will tell you just how Neanderthal you are. It’s unbelievable to think that only 5-6 years ago, many researchers would have thought that was plain wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2413&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2413&#34; style=&#34;width: 983px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-2413&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/neanderthal23andm3.png&#34; alt=&#34;neanderthal23andm3&#34; width=&#34;983&#34; height=&#34;370&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2413&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Unfortunately, I&amp;#8217;m pretty low in Neanderthal since I&amp;#8217;m 50% African, but I&amp;#8217;m excited to get my mom&amp;#8217;s results!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;who-is-human-and-who-is-not&#34;&gt;Who is human and who is not?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the funny things I recall from undergrad is being told that I shouldn’t refer to Neanderthals as “humans” – that was reserved for “modern humans”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think about it, that’s what this discussion is all about. From the beginning of anthropology, and even taxonomy, one of the key questions has been “who is human and who is not?” Is that line drawn between white Europeans and everyone else? Is that line drawn between Eurasians and Africans? Or is it drawn at some point in time, between those whose descendants are present today and those who have left no trace of their existence in populations today? And who gets to decide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most difficult questions in human evolution: what does it mean to be human?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question is the reason why we have such awkward terminology as “modern humans” and “anatomically modern humans” and “behaviorally/cognitively modern humans” – they are all just clumsy attempts to essentialize the differences between groups of closely related people. But you can’t essentialize “humanness” because evolution doesn’t lend itself to clear divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people still believe in the biological species concept. Meaning that we can define a species as a group of individuals that can bear fertile offspring. But most biologists know this definition is very limited.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations of species concepts is also why we struggle to talk about this latest discovery – is this truly a hybrid? Is she just an admixed person between two different populations of the same species?&lt;/p&gt;

    &#34;&#39;We shy away a little from the word ‘hybrid’,&#39; says Pääbo. The term implies that the two groups are discrete species of human, whereas in reality the boundaries between them are blurry&#34; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/ETCoqqREsV&#34;&gt;https://t.co/ETCoqqREsV&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth of the matter is that, at the moment, we don’t know, and that’s very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re learning about just how messy our history is, and how these neat boundaries we have been trying to draw around groups are making us miss the reality of the complex interactions between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thinking back on just how much has changed over the last decade, I’m looking forward to the next decade to come – bring on the discoveries!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you may have heard that a paper was recently published on the genome of a girl who lived around 90,000 years ago and was half-Neanderthal and half-Denisovan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Cohen, Cohen, Cohen, Cohen, Cohen, Cohen, MY MOM WAS A NEANDERTHAL AND MY DAD WAS A DENISOVAN &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/rBsuFBQEBJ&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/rBsuFBQEBJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Carl Zimmer (@carlzimmer) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/carlzimmer/status/1032345952189906945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;August 22, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It kinda made the news…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people were excited, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; just geneticists and researchers working with human fossils. And my favorite thing about a science story going viral is that it brings out the comedy gold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I&amp;#39;m picturing a 13 year old starting secondary school and telling her new friends: &amp;quot;me mam&amp;#39;s a neanderthal, dad&amp;#39;s a denisovan, bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/I4fGRZEmO2&#34;&gt;https://t.co/I4fGRZEmO2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Aoife Hardesty (@aoife_hardesty) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/aoife_hardesty/status/1034131584964849664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;August 27, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Do me like you&amp;#39;re a neanderthal woman and I&amp;#39;m a denisovan man.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bʀɪᴀɴɪᴀᴄ® (@BGH70) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BGH70/status/1033064866096074753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;August 24, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, even 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06004-0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nature’s story on this publication&lt;/a&gt; was feeling cheeky:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the ultimate tweets were without a doubt the Monty Python references:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;This is actually fascinating stuff, but I can&amp;#39;t read &amp;quot;Her mother was a Neanderthal, and her father was a Denisovan&amp;quot; without hearing John Cleese&amp;#39;s French taunter from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/AfthERMhSD&#34;&gt;https://t.co/AfthERMhSD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jon Hancock (@BigJackBrass) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BigJackBrass/status/1032570901047504896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;August 23, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The Neanderthal-Denisovan ancient mashup makes me think of this. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/iGTqFFCCWZ&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/iGTqFFCCWZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Scary Parcak 👻🎃 (@indyfromspace) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/indyfromspace/status/1032348084091736064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;August 22, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while the news articles that ran on this story gave a good overview of why researchers were excited about it, without the historical context of how we’ve understood human evolution until now, it can be really hard to understand just how incredible this discovery is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s back up a little bit… I’d like to take you back all the way to when I was a wee baby undergrad…&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-are-you-ready-for-story-time-kids&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;/img/story_time.gif&#34; data-caption=&#34;Are you ready for story time, kids?&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Are you ready for story time, kids?
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011 – an entire 7 years ago – I was just starting my first year at university. Going to all these lectures and learning about archaeology, social anthropology, and biological anthropology was really exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the thing I loved most, was all the time we got to have with the professors in small group settings. To this day, I truly believe that this aspect of Cambridge education is why I feel so comfortable in academia, but that’s a story for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the professors I spent the most time with, was the Archaeology professor at my college, Sir Paul Mellars.&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-this-is-a-picture-of-him-getting-knighted-by-prince-charles-i-dont-know-why-i-find-it-so-funny-but-i-cant-help-but-laugh-that-i-knew-someone-who-went-through-such-a-fancy-ritual&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;/img/mellars_knighted.png&#34; data-caption=&#34;This is a picture of him getting knighted by Prince Charles. I don’t know why I find it so funny, but I can’t help but laugh that I knew someone who went through such a fancy ritual.&#34;&gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;/img/mellars_knighted.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    This is a picture of him getting knighted by Prince Charles. I don’t know why I find it so funny, but I can’t help but laugh that I knew someone who went through such a fancy ritual.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember being terrified to meet him when I came to interview at Cambridge, but once I was actually in and after I’d had a few supervisions with him, that went away.&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-i-know-yall-be-like-pics-or-it-didnt-happen-so-hereby-pics-of-me-paul-mellars-and-the-other-lovely-anthropology-students-at-corpus-christi-college&#34;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;/img/paul-mellars.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  &gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Mellars is probably one of the most entertaining people I’ve ever met. Mostly because, in my eyes, he’s this fancy unicorn who is everything you’d imagine a Cambridge 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_%28honorific%29#Academia&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;don&lt;/a&gt; to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Mellars has this low booming voice, and he would often be smoking his pipe or a cigar in his office. Part of me kind of imagines that this is what Santa looks like in his time off,  which is something I obviously never mentioned to his face (and since I don’t expect he’s online much, I don’t think he’ll ever find out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to get to the point, in our supervisions, he would always tell stories. It was one of my favorite things about him because, unlike other supervisors, he wouldn’t necessarily grill us with questions and I could rely on him doing most of the talking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I distinctly remember talking with him about was Neandertals and why they had gone “extinct”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Mellars wasn’t just any random archaeologist, after all. What he was known and knighted for was, in part, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16xwbv4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;his work on Neanderthals&lt;/a&gt;. He was an expert on stone tools of the Middle-Upper Paleolithic (~300,000-10,000 years ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By studying various stone tool &lt;em&gt;industries&lt;/em&gt; across Europe, archaeologists are able to say something about who might have been making them and when certain people came into contact with others or were perhaps replaced.&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-what-we-can-learn-from-stone-tools-is-awesome-but-god-i-hated-all-my-stone-tool-lectures-and-reading-because-looking-at-variously-carved-rocks-for-hours-is-something-i-simply-dont-have-the-attention-span-for&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;/img/stone_tools.jpg&#34; data-caption=&#34;What we can learn from stone tools is awesome, but god I hated all my stone tool lectures and reading because looking at variously carved rocks for hours is something I simply don’t have the attention span for.&#34;&gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;/img/stone_tools.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    What we can learn from stone tools is awesome, but god I hated all my stone tool lectures and reading because looking at variously carved rocks for hours is something I simply don’t have the attention span for.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So based on the fossil evidence, the archaeological/stone tool evidence, and the genetic evidence (at the time), it appeared that Neanderthals had simply vanished at some point. Or in any case, at some point, the skeletal morphology and stone tools we associate with Neanderthals was gone, and that time seemed to coincide with what was interpreted as the arrival of “anatomically modern humans”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of debate, but very few people who studied human evolution believed that Neanderthals had contributed to the modern human gene pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2012, during my second year, I remember writing essays about why Neanderthals might have disappeared, and evaluating the evidence about them having gone extinct vs having interbred with us. I remember asking Professor Mellars what he thought, and he said it was unlikely Neanderthals interbred with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of what I read about the disappearance of Neanderthals was that “modern humans” must have &lt;em&gt;outcompeted&lt;/em&gt; Neanderthals with our superior cognitive skills or &lt;em&gt;replaced&lt;/em&gt; them after they disappeared due to their inability to adapt to the changing climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t put my finger on it at the time, but I felt weird about the language that was being used around Neanderthals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also felt really uncomfortable that all explanations about this apparent disappearance of Neanderthals seemed to be centered on a post-hoc explanation of why “we” were simply better than them. Despite being wrapped in the language of natural selection, it seemed oddly 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00313220500106170&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;similar to 19th-century arguments naturalizing colonialism and the “inevitable demise” of certain peoples&lt;/a&gt;. And I am certainly not the first person to draw the link between natural selection, eugenics, and colonialism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over the last few years, a lot of things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theories-on-how-humans-evolved-one-origin-or-multiple&#34;&gt;Theories on how humans evolved: one origin or multiple?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before genetic evidence really came onto the scene, most of what we had to base our understanding of human evolution on was fossil evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this fossil evidence, during the late 20th century, two camps had formed: multiregionalists and those who thought modern humans were the product of a single-out-of-Africa expansion (clearly, the latter had a much less catchy group name, but I digress…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiregionalists saw continuity between the skeletal anatomy of archaic hominins (i.e. Neanderthals in Europe and &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; in Asia) and the respective modern populations in each continent. For example, some researchers emphasized the similarity between the “shovel-shaped” teeth found in &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt;, and the presence of similar dental morphology in modern East Asian populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, proponents of the single ‘Out of Africa’ hypothesis saw similarities between the skeletal morphology of late African &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; specimens and all modern humans. Some even went as far as to claim that all modern humans were the result of a ‘cognitive behavioral revolution’ around 70,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980’s, when researchers were finally able to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sequence&lt;/a&gt; mtDNA (DNA that is inherited maternally), it appeared to support the idea that all humans today traced their ancestry back, exclusively, to a single group based in Africa around 200,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, most people abandoned the multiregional hypothesis of human origins, but also any idea that Neanderthals (or other hominins) might have contributed to the modern gene pool at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-new-kid-on-the-block-ancient-dna&#34;&gt;The new kid on the block: Ancient DNA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading about the history of science is fascinating because it shows the extent to which our knowledge is shaped by the technology we have, but also the questions we choose to ask and the tools we use to answer those questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re at all interested in understanding how weird and winding this path to our current understanding of Neanderthal/Denisovan/ancient human genetics was, I’d recommend you read Svante Pääbo’s autobiography 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/books/review/neanderthal-man-by-svante-paabo.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;‘Neanderthal Man‘&lt;/a&gt; where he discusses how he developed the methods that allowed researchers to extract and sequence ancient DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to get back to our story, when we began analyzing ancient DNA, it was a pain and it was difficult. Getting even a small sequence was a huge victory. So when they got a bit of Neanderthal mtDNA sequenced in the late 1990’s, it was something worth celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When complete Neanderthal mtDNA sequences followed in 2008 and 2009, while exciting, the evidence still was in line with a single out of Africa expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, everything changed in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/fire_nation.gif&#34; alt=&#34;the fire nation attacks&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What many researchers in human evolution thought was true fundamentally changed when Svante Pääbo’s group published the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/710&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome&lt;/a&gt; and concluded that there was 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/680&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;evidence of Neanderthal introgression&lt;/a&gt; (genetic contribution) to modern day populations outside of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same year, their group also published the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08976&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mitochondrial (mtDNA) sequence of an unknown hominin&lt;/a&gt;, that appeared to group neither with modern humans nor with Neanderthals – 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/464838a&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;we now refer to them as Denisovans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we were able to sequence the nuclear genomes of both Neanderthals and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09710&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Denisovans&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to get the full picture, rather than just the matrilineal side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there was an “ancient DNA rush” during this time, not everyone was convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, people were proposing 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435202/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;alternative hypotheses based on ancient population structure&lt;/a&gt; that could explain the genetic similarity we see between non-Africans and Neanderthals. In other words, what we see could be explained by the fact that non-Africans came from an ancestral population that was genetically more similar to Neanderthals, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/doubts-about-whether-modern-humans-and-neanderthals-interbred&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;but they did not interbreed with them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we have commercially available genetic reports like 23andMe that will tell you just how Neanderthal you are. It’s unbelievable to think that only 5-6 years ago, many researchers would have thought that was plain wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-human-and-who-is-not&#34;&gt;Who is human and who is not?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the funny things I recall from undergrad is being told that I shouldn’t refer to Neanderthals as “humans” – that was reserved for “modern humans”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think about it, that’s what this discussion is all about. From the beginning of anthropology, and even taxonomy, one of the key questions has been “who is human and who is not?” Is that line drawn between white Europeans and everyone else? Is that line drawn between Eurasians and Africans? Or is it drawn at some point in time, between those whose descendants are present today and those who have left no trace of their existence in populations today? And who gets to decide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most difficult questions in human evolution: what does it mean to be human?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question is the reason why we have such awkward terminology as “modern humans” and “anatomically modern humans” and “behaviorally/cognitively modern humans” – they are all just clumsy attempts to essentialize the differences between groups of closely related people. But you can’t essentialize “humanness” because evolution doesn’t lend itself to clear divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people still believe in the biological species concept. Meaning that we can define a species as a group of individuals that can bear fertile offspring. But most biologists know this definition is very limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;That the Biological Species Concept is the product of an attempt to rationalize an obsession with sorting messy reality into museum drawers. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/NclGXbtE7p&#34;&gt;https://t.co/NclGXbtE7p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Magnus Nordborg (@magnusnordborg) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/magnusnordborg/status/1015523873322913792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 7, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limitations of species concepts is also why we struggle to talk about this latest discovery – is this truly a hybrid? Is she just an admixed person between two different populations of the same species?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;#39;We shy away a little from the word ‘hybrid’,&amp;#39; says Pääbo. The term implies that the two groups are discrete species of human, whereas in reality the boundaries between them are blurry&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/ETCoqqREsV&#34;&gt;https://t.co/ETCoqqREsV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; John Hawks (@johnhawks) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/johnhawks/status/1032617342033899520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;August 23, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Infographic tracing the relationship between humans and ancient related species after scientists find evidence of a prehistoric love child between a Neanderthal and Denisovan&lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/hxmT8aPCBA&#34;&gt;https://t.co/hxmT8aPCBA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/YmaeiCVtQ8&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/YmaeiCVtQ8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; AFP news agency (@AFP) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1032546386074583040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;August 23, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth of the matter is that, at the moment, we don’t know, and that’s very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re learning about just how messy our history is, and how these neat boundaries we have been trying to draw around groups are making us miss the reality of the complex interactions between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thinking back on just how much has changed over the last decade, I’m looking forward to the next decade to come – bring on the discoveries!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#808080;&#34;&gt;Estimated reading time: 7 mins (1295 words)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2301&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2301&#34; style=&#34;width: 4592px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2301 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_8859.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_8859&#34; width=&#34;4592&#34; height=&#34;3448&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2301&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;A micrograph of a light and dark hair shaft crossing each other.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever gotten into a debate about someone’s hair color?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Remember that blonde?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Which blonde? You mean, Jessie? Her hair is light brown&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;No, it&amp;#8217;s clearly dark blonde&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;You need to get your eyes checked, that&amp;#8217;s light brown&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
  /end scene
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same goes for dark brown to black. And I’m pretty sure I’ve heard people argue that they’re not ‘redheads’ but actually they’re ‘strawberry blonde’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can hair color be so debatable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s because hair color categories are an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2302 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/tenor.gif&#34; alt=&#34;tenor&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hair color categories are arbitrary groups that we distinguish and name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And clearly, they can be highly subjective…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no absolute way to categorize someone’s hair color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is blond/brunette or strawberry blond/red-haired depends on how you decide to define those categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show you why hair color categories are a lie and how we get the amazing palette of hair colors we see today, I’ve decided to share with you guys how hair gets its color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Overview of today&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Hair gets its color from a pigment called &lt;strong&gt;melanin&lt;/strong&gt;, which is found in a red/yellow form (&lt;strong&gt;pheomelanin&lt;/strong&gt;) and a brown/black form (&lt;strong&gt;eumelanin&lt;/strong&gt;). The ratio and absolute amount of these pigments determine the color of hair.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Melanin is produced in &lt;strong&gt;melanosomes&lt;/strong&gt; (organelles) of the &lt;strong&gt;melanocytes&lt;/strong&gt; (melanin-producing cells) in hair follicles during the anagen (growth) phase. (Feel free to check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://humanhairdiversity.com/2017/09/20/the-basics-anatomy-the-hair-growth-cycle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;beginner&amp;#8217;s guide to hair growth &amp; anatomy&lt;/a&gt; if you need a refresher.)
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Melanosomes are then transferred from the melanocytes to &lt;strong&gt;keratinocytes&lt;/strong&gt; (keratin-producing cells) and produce pigmented hair shafts.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this overview went too fast for you, no worries, we’re going to break it down below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  You may have heard of the word &lt;em&gt;melanin&lt;/em&gt; before. On this blog, you can expect to hear it all the time because I’m all about the pigment (and so is my research)! In this first post on melanin, I will introduce you to a number of melanin-related vocabulary as I give you a basic description of melanin production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  You may be wondering, for someone studying human hair diversity, why would I be interested in the &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt; of hair pigmentation?  The answer is: all the steps in the process of hair pigmentation are points at which we can have variation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  At each step, something can go wrong/right/differently. This means that the final result (i.e. hair color) can change because of any of this reasons. So, for someone who is interested in how and why humans vary in hair color, understanding all the things that could possibly cause the differences we observe is pretty important!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Hopefully, this will motivate you to bear with me through the explanations of the process so we can understand the how all of this diversity came to be!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  (I am a firm believer in the positive power of exclamation marks so I have no doubt you have been bathed in motivation by the last few sentences &amp;#8211; you are totally welcome!)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-220&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/hair-bulb-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;hair bulb-03.png&#34; width=&#34;7427&#34; height=&#34;5400&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Melanin-producing cells called &lt;em&gt;melanocytes&lt;/em&gt; are responsible for the pigmentation of keratin-producing cells called &lt;em&gt;keratinocytes&lt;/em&gt;. Melanocytes and keratinocytes are both found in hair, as well as in skin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  There is a special set of melanocytes called the hair follicle pigmentary unit that is responsible for pigmenting the hair shaft. These melanocytes are found in the hair bulb, above and around the dermal papilla.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Melanin production + vocabulary&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Melanogenesis&lt;/em&gt; is the production of melanin. In pigmented human hair, we may find both &lt;em&gt;pheomelanin&lt;/em&gt; (a red-yellow pigment) and &lt;em&gt;eumelanin&lt;/em&gt; (a brown-black pigment). The entire process of &lt;em&gt;melanogenesis&lt;/em&gt; takes place in &lt;em&gt;melanocytes&lt;/em&gt; (cyte = cell). Inside the melanocyte, melanin is produced inside &lt;em&gt;melanosomes&lt;/em&gt; (organelles related to lysosomes).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Now, the biological pathway for melanin synthesis is complex (although I have to say, I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ve ever come across a biological pathway that was not complex). This means that we can ease into that topic in a later blog post! For now, all you need to know is that the melanosomes mature in the melanocytes before being transferred into the keratinocytes of the forming hair shaft.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2303&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2303&#34; style=&#34;width: 4592px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2303 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_8860.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_8860&#34; width=&#34;4592&#34; height=&#34;3448&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2303&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Another micrograph of hairs, just for the hell of it. These are a bit more red in color than the first hairs you saw in this post.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Melanosome transfer&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  As mentioned above, pigmented hair shafts get their color from the melanin-filled organelles (melanosomes) that are transferred to the keratin-cells of the hair shafts (keratinocytes). So, how did these melanosomes end up in keratinocytes?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Over the years much knowledge has been generated by researchers who have looked into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;black box&lt;/a&gt; process that is &lt;em&gt;melanosome transfer&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Over these many years, thoughts about how these organelles end up keratinocytes have evolved, and so has the technology we have available to us. For example, now we can see cells &amp;#8216;in action&amp;#8217; and, as you can imagine can give us a completely different picture of the dynamic process that is melanosome transfer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-221&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/melanosome-transfer-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;melanosome transfer-04.png&#34; width=&#34;6327&#34; height=&#34;4973&#34; /&gt;Taking this important bit of history into consideration, we can describe four types of hypotheses put forward about how exactly melanosomes end up in keratinocytes&lt;sup&gt;3,4&lt;/sup&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Membrane fusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Melanocytes are dendritic cells, which means they have tentacle-like protrusions sticking out of the body of the cell. This hypothesis suggests that melanosomes may be transferred by a fusion of the cell membranes of melanocytes (and their dendrites) to keratinocytes, after which the melanosomes pass through this &amp;#8216;channel&amp;#8217;.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shedding-phagocytosis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Another hypothesis is that melanosomes are packaged in little membrane-bound vesicles that are &amp;#8216;shed&amp;#8217; by the melanocyte and are then phagocytized (&amp;#8220;eaten&amp;#8221;) by the keratinocyte.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exocytosis-endocytosis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This hypothesis proposes that melanosomes are released without being packaged and bound into the intercellular space and then incorporated by the keratinocyte.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cytophagocytosis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Lastly, it has been suggested that the keratinocyte may be actively phagocytizing melanosome-rich dendrites.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  There is the most evidence for the shedding-phagocytosis mechanism.&lt;sup&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt; Regardless, once the melanosomes are transferred to keratinocytes, these cells are pigmented, and as the hair shaft grows from the hair follicle, a pigmented hair will appear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Same process; different colors&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The same process of melanogenesis described above can produce very different hair colors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2305&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2305&#34; style=&#34;width: 4592px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2305 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_8873.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_8873&#34; width=&#34;4592&#34; height=&#34;3448&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2305&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;In some cases, hair follicles right next to each other can produce very different hair colors.  These hairs all come from the same spot on one person&amp;#8217;s scalp.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Regardless of the final color of the hair shaft, all pigmented hairs get their color from melanin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This melanin comes in two forms: pheomelanin (red-yellow) and eumelanin (brown-black).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the funny thing is that all pigmented hairs have BOTH types of melanin. The lightest strawberry blond hair will contain brown-black eumelanin and the darkest black hair will contain red-yellow pheomelanin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as you can see, understanding hair color is not a simple matter of looking at a hair and describing its color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-2306 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/giphy14.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy14&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;270&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if the process of pigmenting hairs is the same for all hair colors, and the building blocks are the same – why do we see differences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that the absolute amount of melanin and the ratio of the two melanins can be different. But, ultimately, combining pheomelanin and eumelanin in various amounts and ratios is what produces all hair colors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, next time you get into a debate about the precise cut-off between dark blond and light brown, remember that those categories are absolutely arbitrary and this is a pointless debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, as someone who feels very strongly about the pronunciation of GIF, I completely understand if hair color is something you want to fight about…&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#808080;&#34;&gt;Estimated reading time: 3 mins (610 words)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;ve watched enough American TV to know that summer camp is a thing in the USA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I was introduced to it through the classic twin movies: It Takes Two and The Parent Trap.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1910&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-1910&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1910&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;342&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-1910&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;These movies have given me the false expectation that you always meet your twin at summer camp, though&amp;#8230;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And the wondrous thing about American summer camps is that they don&amp;#8217;t just come in one flavor! There&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;band&lt;/em&gt; camp, &lt;em&gt;sports&lt;/em&gt; camp, &lt;em&gt;adventure&lt;/em&gt; camp, &lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt; camp, &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; camp, anything-you-can-come-up-with-camp!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And this summer, I got to see kids doing a very special type of science camp &amp;#8211; one that was about &lt;em&gt;genetics and genealogy&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;When science is personal, it&amp;#8217;s more relatable and understandable&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  To quote &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HenryLouisGates&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Henry Louis Gates Jr&lt;/a&gt;.: &amp;#8220;Kids love to study &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;selves&amp;#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1980 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/giphy3.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy3&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m the kind of person who will take time out of their day to click on a headline that says: &amp;#8220;Answer these 7 questions and we&amp;#8217;ll tell you what flavor of donut your soul is&amp;#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So, let&amp;#8217;s just say that I&amp;#8217;m a sucker for learning stuff about myself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And, clearly, I&amp;#8217;m not alone! When my advisor, &lt;a href=&#34;http://sites.psu.edu/ninajablonski/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Nina Jablonski&lt;/a&gt;, was telling me about this camp, she explained that the idea behind the genetics &amp; genealogy camp was making science personally meaningful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  When you are learning about yourself, you&amp;#8217;re invested and you&amp;#8217;re curious. And this summer, I saw that these young scientists were truly engaged with all of this material in an amazing way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Topics like DNA, evolution, and history were no longer a collection of abstract facts, but tools for these kids to answer questions they had about themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I thought was really amazing about this particular camp was the combination of the genetics with the genealogy. Starting off by thinking about your grandparents and great-grandparents is a great way of showing that (human) &lt;em&gt;evolution is just an extension of history. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Here, they called us scientists” – Adalynn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard this, it made me so happy that I nearly cried. Yes, I’m an emotional person. But seriously though, I’m a 25-year old Ph.D. student and this year was probably the first time a professor had referred to me as a scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting these kids know they were scientists was so empowering! I honestly think that just by doing that, they’ve been immunized against &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2008/02/no-youre-not-impostor&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (grad students know what I’m talking about, sadly….).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2022&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-2022&#34; style=&#34;width: 1014px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2022 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/brandon-is-the-bomb.png&#34; alt=&#34;Brandon is the bomb&#34; width=&#34;1014&#34; height=&#34;518&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-2022&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;The camp&amp;#8217;s amazing instructor, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bigdata_kane&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Brandon Ogbunu&lt;/a&gt;, made sure these kids knew _they_ were in charge and could do anything they set their minds to&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching it all come together: &lt;em&gt;Finding Your Roots – The Seedlings &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  While I&amp;#8217;m still pretty salty that I couldn&amp;#8217;t be snuck in to participate as a slightly older, oversized child, watching the web series following this summer&amp;#8217;s camp is arguably the next best thing!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are curious about the genetics and genealogy camp, watch the episodes – I promise you’ll love them (I’ve embedded the videos below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, there are three of these 8-minute gems, and the next 5 episodes will come out over the next few weeks. If you want to keep up with this series, bookmark &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fyrclassroom.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;fyrclassroom.org&lt;/a&gt; and check out the “episodes” tab, or keep an eye on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pbs.org/weta/finding-your-roots/classroom/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;PBS website&lt;/a&gt;. You can also &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TinaLasisi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; because I will definitely be updating on each and every episode that is released!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good reason to bookmark the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fyrclassroom.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;FYR website&lt;/a&gt; is that you’ll find all of the teaching material for each episode as it comes out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect if you want to bring ‘Finding Your Roots’ to your classroom. (Or if you are like me and want to do this awesome &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fyrclassroom.org/episodes/episode-2-dna-extraction.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Fruit DNA Extraction&lt;/a&gt; thing yourself – why should kids have all the fun????)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with that, I’ll leave you to enjoy the episodes:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#808080;&#34;&gt;Estimated reading time: 12 mins (2250 words)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Edit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1395-3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Link to an article&lt;/a&gt; I wrote with my advisor about African skin pigmentation genetics in &lt;em&gt;Genome Biology&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Last week, a research article was published on skin color variation &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; Africa.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1522&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-1522&#34; style=&#34;width: 800px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1522&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/crawford-et-al.png&#34; alt=&#34;crawford et al&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;260&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-1522&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Last week&amp;#8217;s article on African skin color in _Science_&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2017/10/11/science.aan8433&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;READ IT!&lt;/a&gt; It is great, well-written, and has amazing figures! I would actually show you some of those figures if I wasn&amp;#8217;t terrified of publishers coming after me for copyright infringement (look, I&amp;#8217;m trying to finish a Ph.D., here, so I don&amp;#8217;t have time to get sued by journal publishers&amp;#8230;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  If you don&amp;#8217;t have access to these journals, hit up your nearest scholar and ask them for a copy (you can email me!).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And one of the things I really appreciate in this article is that it&amp;#8217;s a study on variation in Africa that actually includes &lt;em&gt;African authors&lt;/em&gt; from African institutions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;This research is important.&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;#8217;s why it was picked up by The New York Times and The Atlantic. These articles are all full of people emphasizing that African diversity is an amazing thing that we need to pay attention to!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Read both of those articles too because they are full of quotes that got me feeling some type of way:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We knew quite a lot about why people have pale skin if they had European ancestry,” said Nicholas G. Crawford, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the new study. &lt;strong&gt;“But there was very little known about why people have dark skin.”&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/science/skin-color-race.html?mwrsm=Facebook&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few human traits are more variable, more obvious, and more historically divisive than the color of our skin. And yet, for all its social and scientific importance, we know very little about how our genes influence its pigment. **What we do know comes almost entirely from studying people of European descent. **– &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/10/a-brief-history-of-the-genes-that-color-our-skin/542694/?utm_source=twb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Ed Yong via The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And there you have it, in bold, the reason I ended up doing a Ph.D. in biological anthropology. I wanted to know more about human biological variation, and I specifically wanted to focus on African diversity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Why is so much of the research on human trait variation focused on Europeans?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember, as an undergraduate, hearing so many times that “Africans have the most genetic diversity” but when it came to looking at trait variation, especially skin color, hair color and hair form, all of a sudden, it was like Africans were just a monolith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I remember looking for articles on variation in African pigmentation and hair, but all I could find was dozens of articles on how Europeans had all of these &amp;#8216;diverse&amp;#8217; hair colors and hair types, but Africans could just be described as homogeneously &amp;#8220;dark&amp;#8221; and their hair was simply &amp;#8220;frizzy&amp;#8221;. Mind you, these are not articles from the 19th century, these are things that were published from 2000 onwards.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Research saying that &amp;#8220;Africans have the most genetic diversity&amp;#8221; started to sound a lot like paying lip service without actually believing it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Looking at the 23andMe genetic testing results, I don&amp;#8217;t get the impression that we really respect the idea that &amp;#8220;Africans have the most genetic diversity&amp;#8221; because these are the reference populations for ancestry in Europeans vs Africans:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-1823 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/european-tested-populations-23andme.png&#34; alt=&#34;European tested populations 23andme&#34; width=&#34;390&#34; height=&#34;894&#34; /&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-1824 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/african-tested-populations-23andme.png&#34; alt=&#34;African tested populations 23andMe&#34; width=&#34;389&#34; height=&#34;308&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I mean, you can tell me if I&amp;#8217;ve got &amp;#8220;Balkan&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;French &amp; German&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Finnish&amp;#8221; ancestry but the categories for Africa span a third of the continent? That&amp;#8217;s a problem. But at least, 23andMe is aware of it&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-1828 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/23andme-ancestry-bias.png&#34; alt=&#34;23andMe ancestry bias&#34; width=&#34;767&#34; height=&#34;303&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Why does &amp;#8220;the public&amp;#8221; believe skin color = race?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Based on the titles of the news articles, you&amp;#8217;d think the problem is that everyone equates skin color with race.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  From these headlines, I guess the question should be: &amp;#8220;Who believes race = skin color?&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Surely the Africans living in Africa and traveling around the continent would have noticed that there is a huge range of variation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Is this an American/European problem?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Maybe this does indeed have something to do with who, historically, has designed the racial categories.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  When Linnaeus first divided humans up into subspecies, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#Carl_Linnaeus&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;skin color was indeed one of the classifiers of the different &amp;#8216;human races&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1835&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-1835&#34; style=&#34;width: 436px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-1835 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/linnean-e1508271734129.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;linnean&#34; width=&#34;436&#34; height=&#34;277&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-1835&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Linnaeus original classification of human &amp;#8216;variants&amp;#8217;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But then again, despite decades of critiques, humans can still be categorized by racialized groups that use skin color as a classifier if we take a peek at the U.S. census categories:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1814&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-1814&#34; style=&#34;width: 857px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-1814 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/us-census-categories.png&#34; alt=&#34;us census categories&#34; width=&#34;857&#34; height=&#34;163&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-1814&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Currently on the U.S. census website&lt;/a&gt;. And, honestly, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/interactives/multiracial-timeline/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;looking at the history of the terms, it&amp;#8217;s been worse.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Yes, there is certainly a lag time between scientific consensus and public understanding.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But the problem isn&amp;#8217;t just with &amp;#8220;the public&amp;#8221; understanding science, it&amp;#8217;s also a problem of the things that have been done in the name of science.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Scientific &amp;#8216;objectivity&amp;#8217; doesn&amp;#8217;t mean the field of human biology gets a pass on diversity.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Whenever I read about scientific racism, I inevitably come across some claim that the great thing about Science is that &amp;#8216;it&amp;#8217;s objective&amp;#8217; and that Science is self-correcting and will eventually uncover The Truth™.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But the problem is the Science isn&amp;#8217;t some great force in the universe that just happens. Science is done by scientists, and &lt;em&gt;who those scientists are matters&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Some people genuinely believe that it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; does science as long as it is done correctly The Truth™ will shine through. But that isn&amp;#8217;t necessarily true.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  No matter how perfect your application of the scientific method is (and, honestly, it rarely is applied perfectly), there is still room for bias.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Just because the process of science is supposed to be objective, doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that the hypotheses we think up come from a place of objectivity. Hypotheses are inspired by what we see in the world around us, and that is fundamentally influenced by our perspectives and experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This bias in the hypotheses is especially obvious articles written about sexual selection in skin and hair color and almost everything you find will be about how &amp;#8216;white skin&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;blond hair&amp;#8217; evolved because these are attractive traits (with little to no evidence as to why that is so, just trust the author on this, obviously, this is a fact).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This bias in hypotheses is undeniable in the fact that when we talk about the (pseudo)scientific work on &amp;#8216;racial&amp;#8217; differences in intelligence, it is always about the supposed superiority of &amp;#8216;white&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;European&amp;#8217; people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  There is a very straightforward relationship between those who, historically, have done the science, and who comes out on top when &amp;#8216;scientists&amp;#8217; ask questions about what traits are attractive or superior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Scientific racism is a thing of the past&amp;#8221; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Just because the &amp;#8216;Annals of Eugenics&amp;#8217; has changed its name to the &amp;#8216;Annals of Human Genetics&amp;#8217; doesn&amp;#8217;t mean we&amp;#8217;ve undone centuries of scientific racism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Just because there have been hundreds of articles and books on scientific racism doesn&amp;#8217;t mean we&amp;#8217;ve overcome the systematic and structural problems that made it necessary for those articles and books to be written.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Of course, there has been progress. Many scientists have called out racist work and, some, have even dedicated their lives to fighting scientific racism. For most of the biased hypotheses I mentioned above, there have been eloquent responses by other white researchers pointing out the flaws in those works and questioning the validity of hypotheses seeking to prove superiority.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But why do we rely on white scientists to call out other white scientists? Why is science, especially the science of human biological variation, such a &amp;#8216;white space&amp;#8217;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  A few years ago, James Watson clearly felt comfortable enough to say that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fury-at-dna-pioneers-theory-africans-are-less-intelligent-than-westerners-394898.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&amp;#8216;Africans are less intelligent&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/01/dna-james-watson-scientist-selling-nobel-prize-medal&#34;&gt;he didn&amp;#8217;t expect the backlash&lt;/a&gt; should tell us something about the academic environment he had been living in until that point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The biggest structural problem in science today is that, in the most &amp;#8216;prestigious&amp;#8217; societies, institutions and journals (those that have the most power to construct the scientific narrative), it remains overrepresented by certain demographic groups (i.e. white, male, English-speaking), and underrepresented by others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This influences the kind of science that is done. And it most certainly influences the kind of bad science that slips through the cracks and the kind of biases that are shared behind closed doors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Diversity isn&amp;#8217;t just necessary for fighting &amp;#8216;scientific racism&amp;#8217;, it&amp;#8217;s necessary for improving the quality of science.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Even with the best of intentions, scientists can perpetuate stereotypes. In the case of skin color, clearly, there have been a lot of researchers who could not see any the large variation on the darker end of the skin pigmentation spectrum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This is what I like to refer to as the &amp;#8217;50 shades of Beige&amp;#8217; problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This is the reason why Rihanna&amp;#8217;s Fenty Beauty line of foundation has done so well &amp;#8211; Rihanna recognizes the wide range of skin colors that exist, especially on the darker end of the spectrum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1690&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-1690&#34; style=&#34;width: 1200px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1690&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/fenty-foundation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;fenty foundation&#34; width=&#34;1200&#34; height=&#34;1400&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-1690&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Range of shades available for Rihanna&amp;#8217;s Fenty Beauty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This is a contrast with companies that manufacture products for all the shades of light skin that exist, but apparently, believe that dark-skinned people are one uniform shade:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-1694 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/ysl-foundation.png&#34; alt=&#34;YSL foundation&#34; width=&#34;631&#34; height=&#34;879&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Luckily for scientific work on skin color, we have machines that can measure skin color objectively (reflectance spectrophotometers), so we&amp;#8217;ve been able to quantify the great range of diversity that there has been for a while now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But despite the fact that there have been some researchers who&amp;#8217;ve pointed out this diversity for more than a decade, most of the research on skin color (and its genetics) has remained pretty focused on variation found in Western countries:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The first gene identified as affecting human skin color—MC1R—is very diverse in European populations but remarkably similar across African ones. Based on that pattern, says Tishkoff, some geneticists have concluded that the evolutionary pressure for dark skin in Africa is so strong that any genetic variants that altered skin color were ruthlessly weeded out by natural selection. &lt;strong&gt;“That’s not true,” says Tishkoff—but it’s what happens when you only study skin color in Western countries. “When you look at this African-centered perspective, there’s a lot of variation.”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/10/a-brief-history-of-the-genes-that-color-our-skin/542694/?utm_source=twb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  We need an African-centered perspective.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  This is especially true in my area of study &amp;#8211; human hair diversity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Even with skin color, which we can measure objectively, there&amp;#8217;s been a bias in the research and homogenization of African variation, so just imagine for a second what the situation is like for hair variation, which we don&amp;#8217;t yet have good methods of measurement for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I can tell you, the situation is pretty bad.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  While people have suggested a number of ways of measuring hair curl, if you look for genetic studies of people&amp;#8217;s hair, what you&amp;#8217;ll find is that researchers simply categorize people&amp;#8217;s hair visually into: &amp;#8216;straight&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;wavy&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;curly&amp;#8217; &amp;#8211; and not so surprisingly, these studies focus on European hair variation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10815&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;One of my favorite genetic studies&lt;/a&gt; on pigmentation and hair form uses a diverse group of Latin Americans, but guess what their categories are for hair curl? &amp;#8216;Straight&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;wavy&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;curly&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;frizzy&amp;#8217;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Like I said, even the best of intentions won&amp;#8217;t save you from the need for diversity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The Afro-descendant people in that study cohort probably had a range of hair textures and to reduce that variation to &amp;#8216;frizzy&amp;#8217; is not just problematic because it&amp;#8217;s an insulting term, it also homogenizes a group of diverse people using the hair equivalent of the &amp;#8217;50 shades of Beige&amp;#8217; approach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I understand the need to use categories if you have a huge amount of data and no good way to measure a trait. But there are options.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And if there had been African or Afro-descendant women involved with the design of the study, I&amp;#8217;d think someone would have pointed out that for a few years now, there have been more sophisticated categorizations people with tightly curled hair use to describe their hair types:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34; size-full wp-image-1726 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/curly-hair-types.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;curly hair types&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;442&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Think of all the scientific discoveries we are missing out on because we don&amp;#8217;t seek the perspectives of people who can see all of this variation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Hopefully, in a few years, we can do with hair what we have done for skin and then we can happily read articles telling us about the huge range of diversity in hair within Africa.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Hopefully, in a few years, we won&amp;#8217;t be as &amp;#8216;surprised&amp;#8217; that Africans are not all the same.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Again, I&amp;#8217;m very excited about the article that just came out and I will continue to share the hell out of it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-width=&#34;550&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
    “Africa is not some homogenous place where everyone has dark skin. There’s huge variation.” YES, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SarahTishkoff?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@SarahTishkoff&lt;/a&gt;, TELL THEM!!! &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/hsl3GciB0m&#34;&gt;https://t.co/hsl3GciB0m&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I just wish we weren&amp;#8217;t so surprised about African diversity, and I believe this &amp;#8216;surprise&amp;#8217; is related to the fact that &lt;em&gt;even when Africans and Afro-descendants are the subjects of scientific interest, we are not often enough the ones shaping the work that is being done&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Diversity in other areas of science and other types of diversity&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;ve kept this post centered on the biological anthropology/human biology aspect of science because that&amp;#8217;s the discipline I&amp;#8217;m familiar with. Of course, there are other areas in science that would benefit from diversity and there are excellent articles and posts about that from other people on e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-can-we-give-black-and-latino-astronomers-foundation-reach-stars-180960213/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/education/2015/05/mathematics-pipeline-uncommon-dialogue/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. Some excellent people to follow on this issue include the astrophysicists &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/IBJIYONGI&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Chanda Prescod-Weinstein&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JedidahIslerPhD&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Jedidah Isler&lt;/a&gt;, the biologist &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DNLee5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Danielle Lee&lt;/a&gt; and the podcasts &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/VanguardSTEM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;VanguardSTEM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;gr-progress&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/phdivaspodcast&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;PhDivas&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/diversity-in-stem-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;here&amp;#8217;s another article &lt;/a&gt;on diversity in STEM just to get you going.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Most of what I&amp;#8217;ve talked about here is the way in which black/African opinions would impact science, but it is important to include other underrepresented perspectives as well. These include (but are not limited to) perspectives from: non-English speakers (there&amp;#8217;s a whole world out there that&amp;#8217;s ignored because people can&amp;#8217;t publish in what happened to become the &amp;#8220;common&amp;#8221; language), non-Western people, people from non-industrialized societies, people who&amp;#8217;ve grown up in poverty, LGBTQ people &amp;#8211; all of these need to have a voice in science if we truly want to strive for excellence and innovation.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#808080;&#34;&gt;Reading time: 9 minutes (1564 words)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  We all have to deal with our hair.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Maybe you braid it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Maybe you wash it every day with the fanciest of shampoos.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Maybe you&amp;#8217;ve dyed it every shade of the psychedelic rainbow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Ooooorrrrrr maybe it&amp;#8217;s been a hot minute since you&amp;#8217;ve grown a full head of hair, so it&amp;#8217;s not exactly a daily concern&amp;#8230;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_972&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-972&#34; style=&#34;width: 298px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone  wp-image-972&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/giphy11.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy11&#34; width=&#34;298&#34; height=&#34;206&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-972&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure Patrick Stewart saves mad money on celebrity hairstyling.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Either way, &lt;strong&gt;we have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; dealt with hair at some point in our lives. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Yet we know very little about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Before I actually started studying hair, I probably spent a good 20 years of my life not knowing anything about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Clearly, I survived.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So I&amp;#8217;m not gonna try and tell you that this is essential knowledge or something.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  BUT, knowing something about &lt;em&gt;what hair actually is&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how it grows&lt;/em&gt; may help you make more informed decisions about the way you cut/dye/pluck/wax/treat/do whatever to it!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And (BONUS!) for those of you who want to understand the science of hair, a basic introduction to hair growth &amp; anatomy will definitely come in handy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Think of this post as the &amp;#8216;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencechannel.com/tv-shows/how-its-made/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;How it&amp;#8217;s made&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216; of hair:

I just really like this pasta making machine. _How it&amp;#8217;s made_ has excellent pasta GIFs, just saying.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Really, the point of this post is to teach you the basics and answer questions like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;What is hair, even?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;How does hair grow?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;If I shave my mustache, will it grow back thicker? And if so, can I prep for Movember this way?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  I don&amp;#8217;t know what your hair questions are&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m just guessing here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But without further ado, let&amp;#8217;s get on with today&amp;#8217;s lesson!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Overview of the stuff you&amp;#8217;re going to learn:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Hair is part of the &lt;em&gt;integumentary system&lt;/em&gt; and it is an &lt;em&gt;appendage&lt;/em&gt; on the skin.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    There are two parts to &amp;#8220;hair&amp;#8221;: the &lt;em&gt;hair shaft&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;hair follicle.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The layers of the &lt;em&gt;hair shaft&lt;/em&gt; are the &lt;em&gt;cuticle&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;cortex&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;medulla.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The &lt;em&gt;hair shaft&lt;/em&gt; is produced by the &lt;em&gt;hair follicle&lt;/em&gt;, a complex mini-organ in the skin.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The hair growth cycle has an &lt;em&gt;anagen&lt;/em&gt; (growing), &lt;em&gt;catagen&lt;/em&gt; (resting), &lt;em&gt;telogen&lt;/em&gt; (shedding) phase.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    (If you&amp;#8217;re really keen and want to read more, there are scientific references at the bottom that are cited throughout the post with little numbers)
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What is hair even?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The thing we call &amp;#8220;hair&amp;#8221; can more precisely be described as a keratinized &lt;em&gt;appendage&lt;/em&gt; that grows out of a mini-organ in the skin called a &lt;em&gt;hair follicle&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And now, a longer explanation in less fancy language:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Some of you may know that skin is the largest organ in your body (well, I guess &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; your body is more accurate).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But did you know that there are organs within this organ???
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_976&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-976&#34; style=&#34;width: 370px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-976&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/giphy12.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy12&#34; width=&#34;370&#34; height=&#34;322&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-976&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;One might say, there&amp;#8217;s layers to this.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Your skin is part of the &lt;em&gt;integumentary system&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;integumentary system&lt;/em&gt; is an organ system like the circulatory system and the nervous system etc. In these organ systems, a bunch of different organs work together to do stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The &lt;em&gt;integumentary system&lt;/em&gt; is made up of skin and its &lt;em&gt;appendages&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. the stuff that sticks out of it). For humans, this includes mainly hair and nails, but if you have a more avian or reptilian inclination, feathers and scales are also important &lt;em&gt;appendages&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Hair and nails are &lt;em&gt;keratinized&lt;/em&gt; structures. This means that the cells from which they came have become filled with &lt;em&gt;keratin &lt;/em&gt;(a tough protein) and have died in the process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And as a little bonus did-you-know, &lt;em&gt;integument&lt;/em&gt; comes from the Latin &lt;a class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;http://www.encyclopedia.com/medicine/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/integumentary-system&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;integumentum&lt;/a&gt;, which means &amp;#8220;cover&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;enclosure&amp;#8221;. Perfect name for the stuff that keeps our insides from spilling out!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The hair shaft &amp;#8211; the thing we usually think of when we talk about hair&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  When we talk about hair, we usually mean the stringy stuff that&amp;#8217;s growing out of our bodies &amp;#8211; the &lt;em&gt;hair shaft&lt;/em&gt;. But this is only half the story! If we really want to understand how hair works, we also have to talk about &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; this stringy stuff grows, which is the &lt;em&gt;hair follicle&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  BUT, first things first, the &lt;em&gt;hair shaft&lt;/em&gt; that we are all so familiar with, is actually not a simple fiber!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The &lt;em&gt;hair shaft&lt;/em&gt; is frequently described as having three main parts (from outside to inside): a &lt;em&gt;cuticle&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;cortex&lt;/em&gt;, and a &lt;em&gt;medulla&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-129&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/hair-shaft.png&#34; alt=&#34;hair-shaft&#34; width=&#34;4741&#34; height=&#34;3406&#34; srcset=&#34;http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hair-shaft.png 4741w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hair-shaft-300x216.png 300w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hair-shaft-768x552.png 768w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hair-shaft-1024x736.png 1024w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hair-shaft-1568x1126.png 1568w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 4741px) 100vw, 4741px&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The &lt;em&gt;cuticle&lt;/em&gt; is the outermost layer which is often described as consisting of scale-like structures that cover the hair fiber like tiles on a roof.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The &lt;em&gt;cortex&lt;/em&gt; represents the majority of the hair and is made up of &lt;em&gt;keratin&lt;/em&gt; bundles that form long and fiber-like structures (filaments).
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The &lt;em&gt;medulla&lt;/em&gt; is the innermost part which is essentially made up of empty space (more specifically, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/vacuolated&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;vacuolated &lt;/a&gt;cells). It may often be discontinuous or even missing in hair fibers.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The hair follicle &amp;#8211; the thing that actually makes your hair&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  The &lt;em&gt;hair follicle&lt;/em&gt; is the mini-organ which produces &lt;em&gt;the hair shaft&lt;/em&gt;. Essentially, it is the pasta machine to our spaghetti:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_811&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-811&#34; style=&#34;width: 415px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone  wp-image-811&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/giphy9.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy9&#34; width=&#34;415&#34; height=&#34;234&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-811&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;I honestly didn&amp;#8217;t realize how relevant pasta-making GIFs were to hair&amp;#8230;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  However, a slightly more accurate biological depiction might look like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-132 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/hair-follicle.png&#34; alt=&#34;hair-follicle&#34; width=&#34;4737&#34; height=&#34;3403&#34; srcset=&#34;http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hair-follicle.png 4737w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hair-follicle-300x216.png 300w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hair-follicle-768x552.png 768w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hair-follicle-1024x736.png 1024w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hair-follicle-1568x1126.png 1568w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 4737px) 100vw, 4737px&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The &lt;em&gt;hair shaft&lt;/em&gt; exits the &lt;em&gt;hair follicle&lt;/em&gt; through the &lt;em&gt;epidermis&lt;/em&gt; (the top layer of your skin).
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The &lt;em&gt;sebaceous gland&lt;/em&gt; (produces oil in the hair follicle) and the &lt;em&gt;arrector pili muscle&lt;/em&gt; (responsible for ‘raising your hair’ when you get goosebumps) are also associated with the hair follicle.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The &lt;em&gt;inner root sheath&lt;/em&gt; (IRS) consists of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_root_sheath&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;cuticle&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Henle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Huxley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; layer these are involved in shaping the hair&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;outer root sheath&lt;/em&gt; (ORS) is the outermost part of the hair follicle and the ‘&lt;em&gt;bulge’&lt;/em&gt; is a thickened portion of the &lt;em&gt;ORS&lt;/em&gt; where some stem cells of the hair follicle are found.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    At the bottom of the hair follicle, we find the portion known as the &lt;em&gt;hair bulb.&lt;/em&gt; It contains the &lt;em&gt;dermal papilla&lt;/em&gt; which is essential for signaling in the hair growth cycle &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;matrix&lt;/em&gt; surrounding the dermal papilla is full of proliferative (dividing) cells which differentiate into the various layers of the hair mentioned above (medulla, cortex, cuticle, and IRS) &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    So, as the cells of the &lt;em&gt;matrix&lt;/em&gt; divide, older cells are pushed upwards by newer ones. At a certain point, these cells reach the &lt;em&gt;keratogenous zone&lt;/em&gt; which is where the cells of the &lt;em&gt;hair shaft&lt;/em&gt; keratinize and become hard and dead.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  As you just learnt, once your hair is out of the follicle, it&amp;#8217;s dead, so whatever you do to the hair shaft (e.g. cutting/shaving) won&amp;#8217;t have any effect on the hair growing underneath.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So there&amp;#8217;s also no point in covering your hair with avocados and bananas for the healthy minerals and vitamins! (Although you&amp;#8217;ll probably smell like a delicious smoothie!)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  And, if you trim your hair often because you think it will grow faster, I&amp;#8217;m sure you&amp;#8217;re feeling pretty scammed right about now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_790&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-790&#34; style=&#34;width: 500px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-790&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/giphy7.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy7&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-790&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Real footage of a hairdresser telling you that your hair will grow faster if you just come have it trimmed with her every 3 weeks.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But if you wanna give your awesome hair follicles some love as they do the hard work of producing those hair fibers, go for it!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The hair growth cycle &amp;#8211; the circle of life, but for hair&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Now, this is the part where I ruin your dreams of becoming Rapunzel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone  wp-image-756&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/ynlqwrm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ynlqwrm&#34; width=&#34;372&#34; height=&#34;433&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  If you&amp;#8217;ve been avoiding cutting your hair for years and years because you&amp;#8217;re hoping to reach fairytale princess/metalhead lengths, you may be disappointed to learn that your hair will not grow forever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_765&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-765&#34; style=&#34;width: 432px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone  wp-image-765&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/giphy5.gif&#34; alt=&#34;giphy5&#34; width=&#34;432&#34; height=&#34;324&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-765&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Still waiting for someone to propose long hair evolved because of sexual selection on metalheads.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Your hair grows in a cycle! This means it doesn&amp;#8217;t grow forever, but it grows for a while, then stops, then falls out. Luckily, human hairs aren&amp;#8217;t synced up, or you would have awkward moments of hairlessness every now and then&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  But the hair growth cycle for scalp hair looks something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-116 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/growth-cycle-pie-chart.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Growth cycle pie chart&#34; width=&#34;960&#34; height=&#34;752&#34; srcset=&#34;http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/growth-cycle-pie-chart.jpg 960w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/growth-cycle-pie-chart-300x235.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/growth-cycle-pie-chart-768x602.jpg 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    During &lt;em&gt;anagen &lt;/em&gt;(growth), the &lt;em&gt;matrix cells&lt;/em&gt; are proliferating and keratinizing as they move up – the hair grows. The duration of this phase is variable among people, but it is usually about 4-6 years for scalp hair. While human hair does grow asynchronously (which means hairs in the same region may be at different points in the growth cycle), about 90% of the hair will usually be at some point in the anagen phase.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    During &lt;em&gt;catagen&lt;/em&gt; (resting), the cells stop proliferating and programmed cell death begins to destroy the lower (cycling) part of the &lt;em&gt;hair follicle&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;matrix&lt;/em&gt; hardens and the &lt;em&gt;hair follicle&lt;/em&gt; is loosely attached to the &lt;em&gt;dermal papilla&lt;/em&gt; (which you will remember is a mesodermal derivative, unlike the rest of the hair follicle). This phase only lasts a few weeks.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    In the &lt;em&gt;telogen &lt;/em&gt;(shedding) phase, the &lt;em&gt;hair follicle&lt;/em&gt; is not doing much and the hair is just waiting to be shed (which can take around 4-6 months)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    The &lt;em&gt;anagen&lt;/em&gt; phase is reinitiated by signaling between the ‘&lt;em&gt;bulge’&lt;/em&gt; (in the permanent portion of the hair follicle) and the &lt;em&gt;dermal papilla, &lt;/em&gt;prompting the growth of a new &lt;em&gt;hair bulb &lt;/em&gt;and restarting the entire process&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So if you glanced over the hair growth cycle chart, you may have gotten worried for a second that your eyebrows and leg hair are growing for years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t worry&lt;/span&gt;, they have much shorter growth cycles! Scalp hair has the longest duration of hair growth on the body.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Other hair on the body has shorter cycles and there&amp;#8217;s quite a bit of variation in the duration of different parts of the cycle depending on the region of the body and on the individual &amp;#8211; but that&amp;#8217;s a story for another time!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  That was it: the beginner&amp;#8217;s guide to hair growth &amp; anatomy!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  So, out of curiosity, did you know any of this? Or was this all new to you?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
  Are there any other (science) questions/shower thoughts you&amp;#8217;ve had about hair?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:justify;&#34;&gt;
