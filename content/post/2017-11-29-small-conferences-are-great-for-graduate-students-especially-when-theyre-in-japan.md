<p style="text-align:justify;">
  I was at a conference in Kobe, Japan.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  And it was AWESOME!
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Funny thing is I only found out I was going to this conference about two weeks before it started.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  How did that happen? Well, I&#8217;m glad you asked&#8230;
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  So, at the moment, I&#8217;m in the process of putting together my <em>doctoral committee</em>. Basically, I&#8217;m asking a bunch of professors if they would kindly agree to evaluate my work and be the judges at my defense when I finish up this Ph.D.
</p>

<!--more-->In September, I met a professor who was potentially going to be on my committee (he has since agreed, yay!). This professor, Larry Kenney, is a professor in Kinesiology & Physiology. (This may not immediately seem like a logical choice of committee member for an anthropologist studying hair, but Dr. Kenney knows a lot about thermoregulation which is handy if you want to figure out whether human hair morphology affects our ability to stay cool in the sun.)

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Towards the end of October, Dr. Kenney introduced me to a collaborator of his who would be able to help me with designing the experiments for my research, Dr. George Havenith.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Since Dr. George Havenith was based at Loughborough University in the UK, our first conversation was over Skype.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Our virtual meeting went very well! We talked about some ideas for experiments and simulations, I even had the chance to flex my Dutch language skills as both Dr. Havenith and I are from the Netherlands.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  <strong>This is where things got interesting.</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Dr. Havenith and Dr. Kenney mentioned they were going to a conference in Japan in three weeks.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Then they suggested that I should come along.
</p>

<figure id="attachment_2283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2283" style="width: 245px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-2283" src="https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/giphy5.gif" alt="giphy5" width="245" height="245" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2283" class="wp-caption-text">I was, as the kids say, SHOOK.</figcaption></figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  At first, I thought they were joking, but they insisted that this would be a great opportunity for me to present my ideas to a crowd of experts who could give me feedback and ideas on how to test my hypotheses.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  <strong>Needless to say, I did not need a lot of convincing. When someone asks you &#8220;Do you want to go to Japan?&#8221; you say &#8220;How long do I have to pack my bags?&#8221; </strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  But realistically, this conference was in 3 weeks and I did not have the kind of spare cash lying around to go on a trip like this.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  I didn&#8217;t think this was going to happen, but Dr. Kenney and Dr. Havenith encouraged me to ask my advisor about it.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  In the Netherlands, we have this great saying:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <em>&#8216;Nee&#8217; heb je al, &#8216;ja&#8217; kun je krijgen.</em>
</p>

Which translates to:

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <em>You already have &#8216;no&#8217;, but you could get a &#8216;yes&#8217;. </em>
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Basically, this is the Dutch version of &#8220;it never hurts to ask&#8221;. And boy was this true. I asked my advisor (Dr. Nina Jablonski) and she immediately said: &#8220;Yes, this is a great idea, let&#8217;s get it sorted out ASAP.&#8221;
</p>

<figure id="attachment_2285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2285" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-2285" src="https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/giphy7.gif" alt="giphy7" width="500" height="390" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2285" class="wp-caption-text">She said &#8216;yes&#8217;???</figcaption></figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Then, in about one week I had to throw together an abstract + a poster to send to the conference organizers.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  I thought I was real slick for getting myself into this conference, but when I was writing the 5th version of the abstract and the 245th draft of the poster I definitely was slightly less enthused about the whole thing.
</p>

<figure id="attachment_2286" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2286" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2286" src="https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/giphy8.gif" alt="giphy8" width="500" height="281" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2286" class="wp-caption-text">10/10 would **_not_** recommend making a poster in a week because this is what you will feel like.</figcaption></figure>
  
But luckily it all worked out in the end and I had my poster and I was going to JAPAN!!!!
  
<figure id="attachment_2289" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2289" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-2289" src="https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/poster-done.jpeg" alt="Poster done" width="750" height="1002" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2289" class="wp-caption-text">Talia was just as happy as I was that this poster was finally done because she&#8217;s supportive like that <3</figcaption></figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  And yes, you read that correctly this was the first poster presentation of my academic career!
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  I&#8217;ve noticed that in the U.S. presenting posters and going to conferences is strongly encouraged for graduate students (and even undergraduates!). But since I did my undergrad in the U.K., this wasn&#8217;t an opportunity I&#8217;d had before. And since the first two years of grad school were so full of coursework for me here, I didn&#8217;t have the time to present before.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  <strong>I find it kind of funny that my first poster presentation ever is not even at an anthropology conference, but some things just work out that way, I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. </strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  The conference I went to is the International Conference on Environmental Ergonomics (ICEE for short). This is a conference that happens every other year and it&#8217;s incredibly interdisciplinary with researchers who do mathematical modeling, to experimental physiologists and everything in between.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  And it&#8217;s a very small conference!
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  In total, I think there were only about 200 people attending, and there was only one session at a time.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  This is a huge contrast to the annual meeting for the American Association of Physical Anthropologists where you have thousands of people and 20 things going on at once.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  <strong>Having been to both a big and a small conference now, I can say with confidence that there are some clear benefits to going to a smaller conference!</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  For the first time in my conferencing life (which consists of a grand total of 3 conferences), I was able to actually have meaningful conversations with multiple senior and junior academics.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Usually, at a big conference, it&#8217;s just so overwhelmingly crowded that it&#8217;s intimidating to talk to people you don&#8217;t know (especially as a graduate student).
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  But by the end of this conference, I pretty much knew all the students, professors and other researchers who were there.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  This was in no small way facilitated by the fact that Dr. Kenney introduced me to everyone he knew there. Apparently, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v545/n7654/full/nj7654-377a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this is his M.O. for mentoring students</a>. What can I say? I have been very lucky with the advisors that have come into my life.
</p>

<figure id="attachment_2288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2288" style="width: 717px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-2288" src="https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/image-1.png" alt="image (1)" width="717" height="770" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2288" class="wp-caption-text">Yours truly at her poster.</figcaption></figure>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Thanks to Dr. Kenney and Dr. Havenith (and Dr. Jablonski!) my poster session went really well and I managed to get a lot of excellent feedback on my ideas. All of the conversations I had with people that day will definitely help me in putting together the best plan of action for tackling my research questions.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Another awesome thing about this conference is that I got to meet with a lot of amazing students who are doing really exciting research.
</p>

<figure id="attachment_2290" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2290" style="width: 1334px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-2290" src="https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/okonomiyaki.jpeg" alt="Okonomiyaki" width="1334" height="750" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2290" class="wp-caption-text">Meeting fellow students over beer and okonomiyaki is definitely a plus for this conference!</figcaption></figure>
  
A really important piece of advice that I&#8217;ve heard is: **don&#8217;t just &#8216;network&#8217; with professors, talk to other students.**
  
I couldn&#8217;t agree with this more. When you go to a conference, it&#8217;s a great opportunity to meet famous professors, yes, but the students you are seeing there are your future colleagues and collaborators, so don&#8217;t miss out on the opportunity to meet them too!
  
I feel so incredibly lucky to have had my advisor&#8217;s support in going to this conference. Not only was it a great learning experience allowing me to meet Dr. Havenith in real life, but it was also in JAPAN!!!
  
It was my first time in Japan and, given that I have wanted to go there since I was about 14 years old, this was kind of a dream come true for me and I had to try really hard not to spend the whole week running around screaming &#8220;OMG I CAN&#8217;T BELIEVE I&#8217;M IN JAPAN ASDFJKLF!&#8221;
  
Let me tell you, I took in as much of Kobe as I possibly could during that week and it was fantastic!
  
<figure id="attachment_2293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2293" style="width: 3024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-2293" src="https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/bubble-tea.jpeg" alt="Bubble tea" width="3024" height="3024" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2293" class="wp-caption-text">They had ready-made bubble tea in their convenience stores &#8211; I was in heaven</figcaption></figure>
  
<figure id="attachment_2294" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2294" style="width: 1334px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-2294" src="https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/24259400_10155879280472748_867596541_o.jpg" alt="24259400_10155879280472748_867596541_o.jpg" width="1334" height="750" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2294" class="wp-caption-text">The city was beautiful.</figcaption></figure>
  
The only glitch in the whole thing was that I struggled with some of the customs a bit more than expected:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    I didn’t realize it would be so hard to do this polite Japanese bow thing properly 😭
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Do you hinge from the hips like a deadlift?? And where should my eyes be looking???
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I should’ve googled this before landing *panic*
  </p>

But luckily no one seemed to mind, although my attempts to bow clearly made them laugh!
