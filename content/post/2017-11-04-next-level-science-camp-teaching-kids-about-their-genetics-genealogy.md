  I&#8217;ve watched enough American TV to know that summer camp is a thing in the USA.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  I was introduced to it through the classic twin movies: It Takes Two and The Parent Trap.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  And the wondrous thing about American summer camps is that they don&#8217;t just come in one flavor! There&#8217;s&nbsp;<em>band</em> camp, <em>sports</em> camp, <em>adventure</em> camp, <em>space</em> camp, <em>science</em> camp, anything-you-can-come-up-with-camp!
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  And this summer, I got to see kids doing a very special type of science camp &#8211; one that was about <em>genetics and genealogy</em>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  <strong>When science is personal, it&#8217;s more relatable and understandable</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  To quote <a href="https://twitter.com/HenryLouisGates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry Louis Gates Jr</a>.: &#8220;Kids love to study <em>them</em>selves&#8221;.
</p>

</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  I&#8217;m the kind of person who will take time out of their day to click on a headline that says: &#8220;Answer these 7 questions and we&#8217;ll tell you what flavor of donut your soul is&#8221;.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  So, let&#8217;s just say that I&#8217;m a sucker for learning stuff about myself.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  And, clearly, I&#8217;m not alone! When my advisor, <a href="http://sites.psu.edu/ninajablonski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nina Jablonski</a>, was telling me about this camp, she explained that the idea behind the genetics & genealogy camp was making science personally meaningful.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  When you are learning about yourself, you&#8217;re invested and you&#8217;re curious. And this summer, I saw that these young scientists were truly engaged with all of this material in an amazing way.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Topics like DNA, evolution, and history were no longer a collection of abstract facts, but tools for these kids to answer questions they had about themselves.
</p>

What I thought was really amazing about this particular camp was the combination of the genetics with the genealogy. Starting off by thinking about your grandparents and great-grandparents is a great way of showing that (human) _evolution is just an extension of history.&nbsp;_
  
**&#8220;Here, they called us scientists&#8221; &#8211; Adalynn**
  
When I heard this, it made me so happy that I nearly cried. Yes, I&#8217;m an emotional person. But seriously though, I&#8217;m a 25-year old Ph.D. student and this year was probably the first time a professor had referred to me as a scientist.
  
Letting these kids know they were scientists was&nbsp;so empowering! I honestly think that just by doing that, they&#8217;ve been&nbsp;immunized against <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2008/02/no-youre-not-impostor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impostor syndrome</a> (grad students know what I&#8217;m talking about, sadly&#8230;.).

**Watching it all come together: _Finding Your Roots &#8211; The Seedlings&nbsp;_**

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  While I&#8217;m still pretty salty that I couldn&#8217;t be snuck in to participate as a slightly older, oversized child, watching the web series following this summer&#8217;s camp is arguably the next best thing!
</p>

If you are curious about the genetics and genealogy camp, watch the episodes &#8211; I promise you&#8217;ll love them (I&#8217;ve embedded the videos below).
  
So far, there are three of these 8-minute gems, and the next 5 episodes will come out over the next few weeks. If you want to keep up with this series, bookmark <a href="http://www.fyrclassroom.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fyrclassroom.org</a> and check out the &#8220;episodes&#8221; tab, or keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/weta/finding-your-roots/classroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PBS website</a>. You can also&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/TinaLasisi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow me on Twitter</a> because I will definitely be updating on each and every episode that is released!
  
Another good reason to bookmark the <a href="http://www.fyrclassroom.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FYR website</a> is that you&#8217;ll find all of the teaching material for each episode as it comes out!
  
Perfect if you want to bring &#8216;Finding Your Roots&#8217; to your classroom. (Or if you are like me and want to do this awesome <a href="http://www.fyrclassroom.org/episodes/episode-2-dna-extraction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fruit DNA Extraction</a> thing yourself &#8211; why should kids have all the fun????)
  
So, with that, I&#8217;ll leave you to enjoy the episodes:
