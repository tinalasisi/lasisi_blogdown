Overview:

  * Not too long ago, I had zero knowledge of genetics
  * What this has to do with hair
  * Genes &#8211; where are they? And some other basic stuff
  * Analogies for how your DNA works
  * Links if you want to learn more!

**I didn&#8217;t know the first thing about genetics until I went to university**
  
During my first year as an undergraduate, the Bio Anth classes I took were my first real exposure to genetics. In high school, I didn&#8217;t take any biology classes because I wanted to focus on languages and history (exactly _why_ I was not allowed to combine that with biology, as I wanted to do, is a story for another time). This lack of education on genetics meant that I was intensely terrified at the prospect of having to write essays on this topic during my first year. I remember my attempt to enlist the help of some first year bio-students to explain genetics to me. I remember clearly that my first question was something along the lines of:

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <em>Okay, so, uhm, where exactly are &#8220;the genes&#8221;? &#8211;Â </em>a very confused Tina, circa 2011
</p>

While I am currently by no stretch of the imagination a geneticist, I have since taken (and passed) quite a few exams on this topic and feel competent enough to explore the genetic literature on hair (and other topics). At times, I even feel bold enough to propose new research projects to my advisors! (I know, the audacity, right?)

This long story is all just to say that it very much is possible to learn about genetics even if you are truly starting from scratch as an adult.
  
Now onto the meat of this post&#8230;

**Why are we even talking about genetics? This is a blog about hair evolution, right?**
  
My goal is to understand how human hair diversity evolved. To do that I need to consider two things:

  1. How does hair vary in modern humans?
  2. How did this variation change over time?

A genetic perspective can help answer both of those questions.
  
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Usefulness of a genetic approach to &#8220;How does hair vary in modern humans?</span>&#8221;

  * Why I need genetics 
      * appearance of hair texture + color is determined by both external and internal factors 
          * external: hair products, straightening, coloring 
              * hold all external factors constant, and there is still variation among humans
          * internal: 
              * nutrition (kwashiokor)
              * age (balding, but also changing color/texture)
              * even when you hold all of \*these\* factors constant, there is still variation that appears to be inherent (to some degree), inheritable, and immutable 
                  * genetics

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Usefulness of a genetic approach to &#8220;How did this variation change over time?</span>&#8221;

  * Human history goes further back than written records. 
      * Also, unfortunately, in the case of hair and other &#8220;soft tissue&#8221;, no remains to look at (except in few mummy cases)
  * Can find out when things appeared
  * When things became more common in a population (signs of selection)

**Basics of genetics: where to find genetic stuff and what its called**

  * Location
  * Vocabulary 
      * DNA
      * molecule vs atom
      * basepairs
      * SNPs
      * codons

&nbsp;
  
**Your DNA is like&#8230;**

  * lego/building blocks
  * a template
  * a book
  * a bunch of code

Analogies have their limitations of course, if an analogy were completely accurate, it would stop being an analogy and start being a description! But definitely handy stuff.

  * Crash course
  * Khan Academy
