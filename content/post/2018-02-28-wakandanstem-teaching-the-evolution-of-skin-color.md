February has been a good month.
  
<a href="https://alexispsullivan.weebly.com/sci-comm-updates-blog/sully-asks-a-scientist-tina-lasisi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I got featured on my friend Alexis&#8217; blog for her</a>: &#8216;Sully Asks A Scientist&#8217; series.
  
My birthday brought me some major wardrobe upgrades (thanks to my partner&#8217;s great taste):
  
<figure id="attachment_2344" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2344" style="width: 315px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="  wp-image-2344 aligncenter" src="https://humanhairdiversity.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/28275527_10216244255001590_1835455567_o.jpg?w=400" alt="28275527_10216244255001590_1835455567_o" width="315" height="473" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2344" class="wp-caption-text">This jacket <3</figcaption></figure>
  
And, most importantly, I went to see Black Panther. TWICE. And it may have resulted in me acting a little extra since&#8230;

Plenty of people have talked about how amazing this movie is and there&#8217;s a lot of great analysis on the story and aesthetics.
  
But what I want to talk about is the impact it&#8217;s had.
  
The memes, the outfits, the pure joy!
  
Black Panther has gotten so many of us to dream about a glorious Afrofuturistic world and I think that&#8217;s just magical.
  
I for one, want to see #WakandanSTEM happen.
  
I want Shuri to be our patron saint.

Next time someone asks me what I&#8217;m doing after this PhD, I&#8217;m gonna say I&#8217;m applying to be a professor at the University of Wakanda.
  
If I were a professor at U of Wakanda, I would, of course, be teaching Biological Anthropology and about 60% of my curriculum on Human Variation would be African Diversity (instead of the traditional 0%).
  
<!--more-->


  
My favorite part would undoubtedly be teaching about the evolution of African hair diversity (but that&#8217;s going to have to wait until I actually have some results from this PhD).
  
A close second would be teaching about the evolution of skin color and African skin color diversity (<a href="http://humanhairdiversity.com/2017/10/18/surprise-africans-are-not-all-the-same-or-why-we-need-diversity-in-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which I&#8217;ve talked about before</a>).
  
Even outside of the fictional realm of Wakanda, I love teaching about the evolution of skin color.
  
It&#8217;s one of the most amazingly diverse human traits and it has such a cool evolutionary history.
  
This summer, when I was teaching at the <a href="http://humanhairdiversity.com/2017/11/04/next-level-science-camp-teaching-kids-about-their-genetics-genealogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genetics & Genealogy summer camp</a>, I had the opportunity to teach the kids about the evolution of skin color.
  
It&#8217;s the most fun I&#8217;ve ever had teaching!
  
I loved watching these kids be amazed and excited at how evolution had generated all of the diversity that they see around them today.
  
&nbsp;
  
And on a more personal level, I was really happy to be able to tell all the children of color in that room a story about skin color that was happy&#8230;
  
When I was growing up, the only time I was made aware of my skin color was when we were reading books discussing racism and the history of slavery.
  
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, these things are very important, and they should be taught.
  
But these were the _**only**_ times I ever heard about and saw dark skin.
  
This means that throughout my time at school, kids (of all backgrounds) _only_ learnt about dark skin in negative contexts.
  
Can you imagine how hard it is to think about your skin and _only_ associate it with pain, injustice, and shame?
  
So, I&#8217;m really happy that after teaching them about the evolution of skin color, these kids will be able to associate dark skin with the wonders of natural selection.
  
They&#8217;ll know that dark skin is excellent at protecting you and your folate from the sun!
  
They&#8217;ll know that this is a trait that evolved in many different groups after generations of living in a sunny environment.
  
They will be able to look at dark skin and think about how amazing melanin is!
  
And I hope that knowing all these things will bring them joy and make them smile.
